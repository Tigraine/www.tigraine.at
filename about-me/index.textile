<img src="/images/daniel.jpg" alt="Daniel Hoelbling portrait" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px" />

Hi, thanks for visiting my Blog! My name is Daniel Hoelbling and I am currently studying computer science at the "University of Klagenfurt":http://www.uni-klu.ac.at.

While broadly interested in anything technology related my primary focus is .NET development, best practices, test-driven-development, oo-design and  software architecture.

In the past I have been CTO of pixelpoint multimedia to help them architect and implement the "kaernten.at":http://www.tigraine.at/2009/05/12/the-technology-behind-kaerntenat/ tourism platform for Carinthia.
