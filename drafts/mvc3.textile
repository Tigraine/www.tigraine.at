Hi Guys.

I use MVC3 RC and wanted to take advantage of Razer and the new unobstrusive validation while also using a custom IDependencyResolver.

This is me now venting after spending 2 hours trying to fix this, but maybe someone has the same 

This has led to rather interesting problems.

I currently use the following implementations:

DataAnnotationsModelMetadataProvider for ModelMetadataProvider 
ClientDataTypeModelValidatorProvider for ModelValidatorProvider

Now, if I try to use DataAnnotationsModelValidatorProvider for the ClientDataTypeModelValidatorProvider I can't create a single bloody textbox. 

Any @Html.TextBoxFor() will fail with this exception:

"Validation type names in unobtrusive client validation rules must be unique. The following validation type was seen more than once: required"

This also happens if there is only one Field in the Model with one [Required] attribute. 

I then (after a lot of digging tried the ClientDataTypeModelValidatorProvider and finally managed to get TextBoxFor to work with strings. All my Validation (Required, length etc) now work. But once I try to create a TextBox for a int field I get the following:

"Validation type names in unobtrusive client validation rules must be unique. The following validation type was seen more than once: number"

Back to Square one, but now I've run out of ModelValidatorProvider implementation I could try
