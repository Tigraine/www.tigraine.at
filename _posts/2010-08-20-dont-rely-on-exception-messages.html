<p>Since the dotless 1.1 release we are finally able to present you with good error messages, telling you what line/column the problem was encountered etc. This has led to some tests like this one:</p>  
{% highlight csharp %}
public void DivisionByZero()
{
    AssertExpressionError("Attempted to divide by zero.", 5, "20px / 0");
    AssertExpressionError("Attempted to divide by zero.", 14, "1 + 2 - 3 * 4 / 0");
    AssertExpressionError("Attempted to divide by zero.", 6, "1 + 2 / 0 - 3 * 4 / 0");
}

{% endhighlight %}

<br />

<p>Usually you just check the exception type, but in this case it’s a generic ParseException that has the additional line/column  info on it and does not wrap the DivideByZeroException in it’s InnerException. Obviously the above failed on my machine due to my German locale and I was getting a different exception message. </p>

<p>I first tried to set the thread’s culture to en-GB but this only changes how formats are handled, there are no English exception texts installed on a German Windows machine. </p>

<p>The obvious solution then was to not hard-code the exception message but retrieve it from the DivideByZeroException:</p>


{% highlight csharp %}
[Test]
public void DivisionByZero()
{
    var divideByZeroException = new DivideByZeroException();
    AssertExpressionError(divideByZeroException.Message, 5, "20px / 0");
    AssertExpressionError(divideByZeroException.Message, 14, "1 + 2 - 3 * 4 / 0");
    AssertExpressionError(divideByZeroException.Message, 6, "1 + 2 / 0 - 3 * 4 / 0");
}

{% endhighlight %}

<br />

<p>Takeaway: Make sure you tests run on all locales if your tests rely on exception messages. <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wlEmoticonsmile.png" /></p>
