<p>I decided some time ago that I don't want to blog about non technical stuff any more.    <br />But it's Sunday and I hope you'll excuse this one.</p>  <p>What happened? The-best-girlfriend-someone-can-imagine&#8482; just returned from a 2 week study trip to Slovenia while I've been holding up here in Klagenfurt. Upon returning I imagined it would be cool to celebrate her return with romantic dinner at a Mexican restaurant here in Klagenfurt. </p>  <p>The restaurant I'm referring to is the <a href="http://salud.at/">Salud</a> that usually serves truly great Mexican food. But while their food truly justifies the somewhat high price, their service is just ridiculous!</p>  <p>I've never seen service like this.    <br />In short it's been a really really unpleasant experience, but what really stood out was that the waitress tried to take away my plate while I was still chewing my last bite!     <br />And then she kept standing there for at last 5 seconds watching my girlfriend chew on her last bite too! </p>  <p>There is nothing I hate more than being interrupted while eating at a restaurant, except for being watched while eating. </p>  <p>So, just to compensate for the useless post, here a list of great places to eat (where I actually liked the service) in Klagenfurt:</p>
