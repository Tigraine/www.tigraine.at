<p>The weather has been pretty great the last days, and I used the last weekend for some relaxing and even some bathing in W&#246;rthersee.    <br />I also discovered my new favorite relax location (although it doesn't serve coffee) and I also managed to make some photos (click the image for the flickr photo gallery):</p>  <p><a title="Oberkreuth von Tigraine bei Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15594453@N02/sets/72157605251417084/"><img alt="Unterkreuth" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2105/2523065356_7b7f058100.jpg" width="500" height="198" /></a></p>  <p>But after coming home today (chilled to the bone, W&#246;rthersee is still way too cold for bathing!), I figured out I need to do an java assignment for university till Tuesday.</p>  <p>Needless to say that I thought I'd be done in 2 hours doing some simple hash table implementations.    <br />What happened? They managed to throw 10 pages of mostly meaningless gibberish that specifies how my classes should behave and how the underlying algorithms work. While detailed instructions isn't something bad per se, omitting the UML diagram <strong>IS BAD!</strong> After going through the doc 2-3 times I still haven't identified all of the &quot;added complexity&quot; that should be teaching us OO-design and am searching the course forums for answers to questions that aren't answered by a 10 page long assignment paper :(. </p>  <p>So, yeah: I started at 21:00 and now it's 3 in the morning and my concentration has hit rock bottom so I am reading through specs and their explanation without being able to see the sense in it. </p>  <p><em>If you can't remember what word preceded the one you just read - go to bed.</em></p>  <p>And while we're at it. If you bother with Visual Paradigm: Get yourself a real-edition. Doing everything twice (in code and in UML) really sucks. Especially since code stubs can be exactly derived from UML and vice-versa it sucks doing it in a so terribly clumsy tool as Visual Paradigm for UML. (VP works great, it's just a lengthy process to create a damn operation (public void main(String args[]) is easier to type than to click 30 check boxes and drop downs!)</p>
