<p>The following code is extensible and configurable:</p>  
{% highlight csharp %}
public class Worker
{
    private IValueCalculator valueCalculator = new DefaultValueCalculator();

    public IValueCalculator ValueCalculator
    {
        get { return valueCalculator; }
        set { valueCalculator = value; }
    }

    public decimal Work(int number)
    {
        return valueCalculator.Calculate(number);
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>What happens here is that I am using the strategy pattern to implement different behaviors to keep my Worker class safe from changes to the calculator code. 
  <br />Basically I’m doing dependency injection here, but I don’t inject the class through the constructor but through setter injection. </p>

<p>Since I am not bound to the construction phase of the object, I can easily swap IValueCalculator implementations during the worker’s lifetime without having to reconstruct the whole object. </p>

<p>Now, why is this extensible AND configurable?</p>

<p>It’s extensible because it’s easy to implement the IValueCalculator interface and supply it to a worker instance, without changing any of the plumbing around it. 
  <br />If I want to change the behavior for just one call i can do that very easily:

  
{% highlight csharp %}
var worker = new Worker();
var oldCalculator = worker.ValueCalculator;
worker.ValueCalculator = new AlternativeCalculator();
worker.Work(1701);
worker.ValueCalculator = oldCalculator;

{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>But the real beauty of the whole thing is that an inversion of control container like <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/container/index.html">Castle Windsor</a> can also inject setters, so in absence of a configuration file, the default implementation from the code will be used.

  <br />But once a Windsor configuration is found you can swap the strategy classes through the configuration even without recompiling like this:</p>


{% highlight xml %}
<components>
    <component 
        id="Worker"
        type="Blog_Sample.Worker, Blog_Sample" />
    <component
        id="Alternative.Calculator"
        service="Blog_Sample.IValueCalculator, Blog_Sample"
        type="Blog_Sample.AlternativeCalculator, Blog_Sample" />
</components>

{% endhighlight %}

<p>If you want the default behavior just delete the Alternative.Calculator component and no setter injection will happen. If a service implementing IValueCalculator is present that one will be injected to the Worker.</p>
