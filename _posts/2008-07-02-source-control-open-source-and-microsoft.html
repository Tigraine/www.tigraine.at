<p>Something hit me today when I went into the &quot;Team Synchronization Perspective&quot; in <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>/<a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Subclipse</a> while trying to merge some changes a colleague made with my repository:</p>  <p><font style="background-color: #ffffff"><strong>Visual Studio 2008 doesn't sport ANY source control of ANY kind that's for free!</strong></font></p>  <p>If this isn't true I'm eager to hear about it.    <br />But I only know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Team_System">Visual Studio Team System</a>, and that's not free:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Typically, customers purchase an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSDN">MSDN</a> Premium subscription when licensing the Team Editions and Team Suite, which provides <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/programs/sa/default.mspx">Software Assurance</a> that entitles users to product updates over the life of the subscription. This includes Team Foundation Server Workgroup Edition, development licenses of many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> versions, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Foxpro">Visual Foxpro</a> 9, Visual Studio 2005 Tools for Microsoft Office, development licenses of many server-side offerings, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDK">SDKs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_development_kit">DDKs</a>, a large amount of documentation, and more. The Team Edition and Team Suite products can not be purchased without an MSDN Premium subscription.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Last time I checked, MSDN Premium costs $2,499 and additional $1,999 every following year.</p>  <p>I also used Visual Source Safe before (VSS 2005), and it was a huge pain in the ass trying to work with it due to the &quot;one-guy-check-out&quot; policy it enforces. So if you need some field/method in another class to continue working on your class, you'll be running circles through the office trying to get others to check the file back in (resulting in half-broken check-ins etc).</p>  <p>So I wonder, with all that commitment Microsoft has been showing to supporting and promoting open source (<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a>, <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/">CodeGallery</a>), why in the hell do they keep all the tools that would support open source development away from their users? I think that even Visual Studio Express edition should at least come with decent support for source control <strong>inside </strong>the IDE that is actually able to connect to CodePlex! (There is a SVN bridge, a command line client and the suggestion to get the team edition of VS.).     <br />So, bottom line my CodePlex source control experience has been &quot;lacking&quot;, while I'm getting more and more fond of subversion combined with subclipse.</p>  <p>While I'm seeing subversion becoming more and more &quot;standard&quot; among open source projects (if not THE standard), I wonder why Microsoft is making it intentionally hard to work with Visual Studio on shared projects. </p>  <p>So, as I already hinted at in my post about ASP.NET Wiki, Microsoft seriously needs to get more consistent in their efforts. <strong>Either support OSS and developer collaboration, or don't. But don't try to do so badly. </strong>The way they try right now isn't really going anywhere.</p>  <p><strong>Update: </strong>Btw, Eclipse just released a new version called ganymede that really rocks!</p>  <p><strong>Update2</strong>: Apparently I didn't find this info last time I used Codeplex, but it looks like there is a way to integrate a Team System client into VS called <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Obtaining%20the%20Team%20Explorer%20Client&amp;referringTitle=Source%20control%20clients">Team Explore 2008</a>. I'll be looking at this tomorrow.</p>  <p><strong>Update3</strong>: Mark Phippard just pointed me at <a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/">AnkhSVN</a> for Visual Studio that seems to be a pretty decent SVN client integrated into Visual Studio. Thanks for this link.</p>
