<p>It's usually not considered polite to open new windows whenever somebody clicks one of your external links. Those back and forward buttons are there for a reason, so I strongly encourage people to avoid opening new windows.</p>  <p>But, we all know customers. They get this &quot;but I want this&quot; look the second they discover that users <em>may </em>leave their web site too early (can't say how much this attitude sucks..).</p>  <p>One popular way to do this is to use jQuery to open all external links on your page in a popup (making code that obviously violates the &quot;don't open new windows&quot; rule still validate). </p>  

{% highlight js %}
$(document).ready(function() {
    $("a[rel='external']").click(function(event) {
        window.open($(this).attr("href"));
        event.preventDefault();
    });
});
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now all you have to do is, add a <em>rel=&quot;external&quot;</em> attribute to all outgoing links, and this little jQuery function will take care of making them popup.</p>

<p>Still, this is <strong>bad</strong>. It contradicts the whole idea why they removed the target attribute in the first place, so consider this as a quick'n'dirty hack to satisfy stupid customers.</p>
