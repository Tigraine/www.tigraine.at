I just spent almost 10 hours running in circles collecting different releases of NHibernate, Fluent NHibernate and castle, in a rather futile attempt to make them work together.

NHibernate is currently in 2.1 Beta1 at revision 2.1.0.2001 referencing the latest Castle.DynamicProxy2 at revision 2.1.0.0.

Fluent NHibernateâ€™s current trunk compiles against NHibernate 2.1.0.1001 that in turn is compiled against Castle.DynamicProxy2 2.0.3 thus breaking.

So, while the NHibernate Project and the Castle project managed to match their versions pretty well, the Fluent NHibernate trunk was not.

So, the obvious choice would be to just take all the assemblies that are packed with Fluent NHibernate and work from that. But by doing so I then lack Calst MicroKernel and Windsor, two libraries that are not packed with Fluent NHibernate.

At that point I gave up and simply recompiled the Fluent NHibernate trunk with the latest NHibernate trunk.

In case you need Fluent NHibernate with Castle Windsor i packed my results for you: <a title="Fluent NHibernate (NH Beta 1) packed together with the latest Castle trunk" href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/fluentnhibernatewithcastle.7z">FluentNHibernateWithCastle.7z</a>

Hope this helps.
