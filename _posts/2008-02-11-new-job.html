<p>Yes, I'm going back to work.</p>  <p>I accepted to work on a new ASP.NET web project as CTO and developer for my previous employer <a href="http://www.pixelpoint.at">pixelpoint</a>.</p>  <p>So expect to hear new stuff about ASP.NET and AJAX.NET here on my blog during the next weeks.</p>  <p>The project is called <a href="http://www.pizza.at">Pizza.at</a> and will be a online food delivery service.    <br />I had been working on a previous version that didn't make it to a release while I was working for pixelpoint. Due to time constraints and poor planning the project failed and I was approached some weeks ago to try to get it done during these holidays.</p>  <p>I accepted the deal, mainly because I was offered complete freedom on development (so I can abandon the old codebase).   <br />So, this time around I'm the one to blame if the project goes wrong, because I'm the guy doing all the planning.     <br />I have chosen an agile development process and am currently working on the requirement analysis and some basic design stuff.    <br />Because I want this project to be done fast I decided not to use any fancy new stuff like MVC or Silverlight. The whole project will be done on a SQL 2000 database with normal ASP.NET. Regardless, I'll be using C# 3.5 and some LinQ queries will surely make it into the application.</p>  <p>The whole thing will start later this week after I did another training course at pixelpoint for their employees.</p>
