<p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Barcamp_Vienna_2010.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Barcamp_Vienna_2010" border="0" alt="Barcamp_Vienna_2010" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Barcamp_Vienna_2010_thumb.jpg" width="400" height="100" /></a> </p>  <p>Next weekend (29-30th of May) I’ll be attending <a href="http://www.barcamp.at/BarCamp_Vienna_2010">Barcamp Vienna</a> and plan on having a talk about <a href="http://www.dotlesscss.com">dotless</a> and it’s advantages over regular CSS. Since my last dotless presentation at Barcamp Klagenfurt was a pretty huge success I guess I’ll keep to the basic structure of the talk and also go into some detail around the organizational stuff that’s involved when managing an OSS project. </p>  <p>Since I expect the crowd in Vienna to be more technical than the usual web2.0 enthusiasts/blogger mix we see in Klagenfurt I also plan on maybe delivering a talk on the best SCM there is: <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. </p>  <p>Since the whole thing is hosted by Microsoft I expect a lot more .NET developers to show up, so it should be a fun and interesting weekend. </p>  <p>See you there!</p>
