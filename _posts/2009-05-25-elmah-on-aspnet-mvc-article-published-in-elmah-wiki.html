<p>After publishing my article on <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/2009/04/20/elmah-aspnet-error-logging-on-mvc/">ELMAH for ASP.NET MVC</a> the project owner <a href="http://www.raboof.com/">azizatif</a> asked me if Iâ€™d like to publish my article on the project wiki as documentation.</p>  <p>After almost two weeks of not getting around to do it, last week I finally found the time to polish the post a bit and post it there.</p>  <p>You can read the article at: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/elmah/wiki/MVC">http://code.google.com/p/elmah/wiki/MVC</a></p>
