<p>On my last project I made ELMAH (the ever awesome <a href="http://code.google.com/p/elmah/">ASP.NET error logging framework</a>) <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/2009/04/20/elmah-aspnet-error-logging-on-mvc/">work with ASP.NET MVC</a> by modifying the routing logic a bit. It was quite simple since ASP.NET MVC throws HttpExceptions around quite liberally and you are frequently presented with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screens_of_death#ASP.NET">YSOD</a> that then gets logged by ELMAH. </p>  <p>Using MonoRail the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/elmah/wiki/DotNetSlackersArticle#Signaling_errors">general routine of setting up ELMAH</a> still applies (even simpler), but it’s customary to have a general <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/documentation/trunk/usersguide/rescues.html">rescue view</a> that informs the user when something went wrong. Since the rescue concept in MR basically swallows Exceptions and prevents them from reaching ELMAH we need to serve them to ELMAH through <a href="http://code.google.com/p/elmah/wiki/DotNetSlackersArticle#Signaling_errors">ErrorSignaling</a>. </p>  <p>Defining a rescue in MonoRail according to the tutorials looks like this:</p>  <p></p>  
{% highlight csharp %}
[Rescue("generalError")]
public class DemoController : SmartDispatcherController
{
    [Rescue("indexError")]
    public void Index()
    {
        throw new DivideByZeroException();
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p></p>

<p>The string passed to the RescueAttribute identifies the name of the view to load within your <em>Views\rescues\ </em>folder if an exception occurs. This is bad for us because we can’t execute any code to signal ELMAH on the way to the view and within the view.</p>

<p>This is where the RescueController overload for RescueAttribute comes into play. You can define a whole controller that will handle exceptions and we can execute code there before rendering a view. To do so we just need to implement IRescueController and inherit from SmartDispatcherController:</p>


{% highlight csharp %}
[Layout("default")]
public class RescueController : SmartDispatcherController, IRescueController
{
    public void Rescue(Exception exception, IController controller, IControllerContext controllerContext)
    {
        ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(exception);
        RenderSharedView(Path.Combine("rescues", "generalerror"));
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>We can use this new controller by changing the Rescue attribute:</p>


{% highlight csharp %}
[Rescue(typeof(RescueController))]
public void Index()
{
    throw new DivideByZeroException();
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now in case you want to have multiple error-pages (like one general and one telling the user he did something wrong) you could also define multiple rescue methods inside your RescueController and call each of those when needed:</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>


{% highlight csharp %}
[Rescue(typeof(RescueController))]
public class DemoController : SmartDispatcherController
{
    [Rescue(typeof(RescueController), "IndexRescue")]
    public void Index()
    {
        throw new DivideByZeroException();
    }

    public void List()
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>If an exception was to occur in <em>List()</em> it would get handled by the Rescue method inside your <em>RescueController</em>, if <em>Index</em> throws MR will try to call a method called <em>IndexRescue</em>. And both can be logged by ELMAH.</p>
