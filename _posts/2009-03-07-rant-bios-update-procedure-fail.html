<p>Upon helping a friend of mine assembling a new kick-ass gaming PC. Once the whole system was put together he called me the next day stating that the system feels incredibly slow and crashes whenever he starts up a 3d game. </p>  <p>I rushed to help and after some tinkering we found out that the CPU (a Core 2 E8500 2x3.16 Ghz) was operating at almost 80°C. By contrast, my Core2 E6600 (2x2,4) reaches 36°C under full load.    <br />So, since the CPU cooler was spinning, I am quite convinced that it has something to do with a faulty mainboard or (rather unlikely) a faulty CPU.     <br />My initial thought was to try updating the BIOS in case the problem may go away.</p>  <p>So I went to the ASUS download site, selected the appropriate mainboard model (<a href="http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?modelmenu=1&amp;model=2164&amp;l1=3&amp;l2=11&amp;l3=709&amp;l4=0">P5Q</a>) and downloaded a zip file containing the newest BIOS. Now imagine my excitement when I was presented with a .ROM file inside that zip. Pretty cool huh?     <br />So I went on to download the Afudos BIOS update tool V2.36 that should install the .ROM bios.&#160; <br />Started it: sorry doesn’t work on Windows. (WTF?)</p>  <p>So, following the <a href="http://support.asus.com/technicaldocuments/technicaldocuments_content.aspx?no=546&amp;SLanguage=en-us">instructions provided by ASUS</a> I’m supposed to: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Please insert a clean, unformatted disk into A:\ drive and boot the system into DOS mode. In DOS mode, please type in C:\&gt; FORMAT A: /S or click on“My Computer”icon under Windows O/S, right click on drive A:\ and choose“Format”. By using the procedure above, you can create a boot disk without AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Drive A:\ ? DOS? Autoexec.bat? Config.sys?</p>  <p><strong>ASUS: Are you out of your mind?</strong></p>  <p>When I needed to flash my Dell XPS M1330 Bios with a new version, I didn’t even have to leave my browser to do so. Some weird ActiveX thingy just started and updated my BIOS revision while I was casually checking my email. And ASUS is really telling me this is the way to go if I want to update my brand new socket 775 P45?    <br />C’mon, that’s so 1994 – not even funny any more.</p>
