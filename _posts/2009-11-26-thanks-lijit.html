<p>You may have seen that I use <a href="http://www.lijit.com/" target="_blank">Lijit</a> to power the on-site search for my blog. Since Lijit by default uses a Google custom search to power this (nothing really wrong with that) I became quite unhappy with the results (Google for some reason doesn’t like to index articles but rather indexes categories :(). Since I didn’t find my own stuff through Google, getting the same bad results through Lijit was quite annoying. </p>  <p>So I tweeted this one day:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/image1.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/image_thumb.png" width="244" height="106" /></a> </p>  <p>Well, took about 45 minutes to receive this:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/image2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/image_thumb1.png" width="244" height="120" /></a> </p>  <p>And this very nice Email alongside:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/image3.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/image_thumb2.png" width="684" height="235" /></a> </p>  <p></p>  <p>Well, that was 2 days ago. Search results that I get when using the on-site search are back to what I expect them to be and I’m once again able to find my own stuff. </p>  <p>Thanks Lijit. Great service!</p>
