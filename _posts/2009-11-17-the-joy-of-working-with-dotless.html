<p>Ok, I just spent some time on the <a href="http://www.imagineclub.at/" target="_blank">imagineClub website</a> adding our board’s <a href="http://www.imagineclub.at/Team/List.aspx" target="_blank">bio page</a>. The HTML is not really interesting, but since imagineClub was written while <a href="http://www.dotlesscss.com/" target="_blank">dotless</a> was still in development I wrote the CSS the old fashioned way. </p>  <p>Since <a href="http://www.dotlesscss.com/" target="_blank">dotless</a> has reached some maturity I’ve been dogfooding it on imagineClub to make use of the minifier and the caching, but never had any real LESS code in there.     <br />When I had to fix something today I was so happy to be able to write CSS like this:</p>  
{% highlight css %}
div#team
{
    width: 414px;
    p
    {
        float: right;
        width: 300px;
    }
    h2
    {
        clear: right;
        font-size: @title-fontsize - 4;
    }
    img
    {  
        width: 100px;
        margin-bottom: 4px;
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>This is how CSS was supposed to be, and with <a href="http://www.dotlesscss.com/" target="_blank">dotless</a> it has become just mindlessly easy to do.. </p>
