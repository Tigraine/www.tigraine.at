<p><img title="vibrantink" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="266" alt="vibrantink" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/vibrantink.png" width="487" border="0" /> </p>  <p>After looking at the default color settings of Visual Studio for the last 8 years of my life I finally decided to give Rob Conery’s <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/10/17/textmate-theme-for-visual-studio-take-2/">Vibrant-Ink theme for Visual Studio</a> a try. </p>  <p>I discovered this lovely little theme quite some time ago, but I really didn’t see any benefit from changing my settings to this, so I forgot about it.    <br />Until recently I started to feel the pain of working 10+ hours on a mediocre screen.     <br />Eye strain was quite bad, and when someone <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/119064/tips-for-reducing-eye-strain">suggested the theme</a> (again) at Stackoverflow I finally tried it.</p>  <p>And, I have to admit, not only does my VS now look way cooler. <strong>My eyes feel less tired after long hours of work. </strong></p>  <p>I would definitely suggest trying the theme, it’s just incredible.</p>  <p>Get the theme over at <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/10/17/textmate-theme-for-visual-studio-take-2/">Rob Conery’s Blog</a> and maybe adjust it a bit <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/astopford/archive/2008/09/17/vibrantink-for-tired-eyes.aspx">like Andrew Stopford suggests</a>. But still, stick with Consolas as your font!</p>
