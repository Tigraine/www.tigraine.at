<p>Software design is hard. Not so much because it’s so hard to come up with, but because it takes a very long time to really hit the sweet spot where you really feel it’s good. </p>  <p>Doing this on your own is almost impossible, because you constantly have to switch off your personality and challenge the assumptions you just made when writing something.    <br />I ask myself all the time “Is this module really right here? Should I break this up into smaller modules?” .. And frankly, I am the wrong person to answer that question since I made the mistake in the first place.     <br />So I challenge myself all the time into the mindset of another person (be it a user, tester etc..) and try to forget what I was just thinking for a minute to decide if I’m still on track or not. </p>  <p>It’s like driving alone in a car through unknown terrain, you have to stop all the time and pull out the map to see if you’re still driving in the right direction or not. </p>  <p>And honestly, it sucks big time. Stopping is always bad. Dropping out of your “zone” and doing a complete context switch hurts the flow and I feel mentally exhausted very fast, and nothing seems to get done in the long run.</p>  <p>So, at my current project I decided that I can’t go on on my own. I tried multiple times to get to a good design through lots and lots of whiteboard, spiking and experimenting. But I never quite nailed it, I always felt like 20% away from the real thing, but with a burned bridge in front of me. </p>  <p>So, when I called my employer last Sunday I asked one thing “Do I get some budget to bring in a second pair of eyes to work on this particular problem?”. And the awesome answer was “Just do it and spare me the details.”.</p>  <p>Next day I called <a href="http://www.appcom.at/index.php">Harald Logar</a> and he agreed to stop by and go through the code with me for a day. I gave him a very brief heads up on what I was working on (mind you, he’s a complete outsider to the project) and what problem I’m trying to solve.</p>  <p>When he came in next day I explained the vision, and showed him some tests I prepared before that should demonstrate the “desired” behavior of the system. After that little introduction, we were already implementing like crazy.</p>  <p>It was amazing! Although I was doing most of the typing, Harald was constantly there to challenge my assumptions, answer my questions and throw in his own ideas when necessary.    <br /></p>  <p>But what was really an game changer for me that day was that we were not only good, we went faster than I had ever done in the past. We rewrote the complete data access logic of a rather complex system in less then 2 hours (complex means dynamic proxies, caching and some non-trivial retrieval stuff).</p>  <p>We then spent the rest of the day optimizing the system (performance is very critical for the project) and I think we both learned a great deal about the inner workings of .NET collections and how they work performance wise. (We also implemented a very cool cache solution that clears the cache on a background worker thread to avoid downtime)</p>  <p>So, needless to say I’d do this again any time. Harald was a joy to work with, and I think by the end of the day we were both very proud of what we accomplished.</p>
