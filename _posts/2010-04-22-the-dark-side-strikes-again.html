<p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/image.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/image_thumb.png" width="443" height="262" /></a></p>  <p>Oh, Microsoft took it’s sweet time with Visual Studio 2010 and C#4 but now that it’s finally here I had to find out that the <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/2008/10/23/come-to-the-dark-side-we-have-cookies/">Vibrant Ink theme I’ve been using</a> for years now needs an update to match new stuff in the language.</p>  <p>Thank god I did a quick search to see if someone already did that, and I stumbled on a pretty cool little website: <a href="http://studiostyles.info/">studiostyles.info</a>     <br />A website dedicated to Visual Studio Themes, apparently written in ASP.NET MVC it allows users to create styles with a pretty simple editor and then share it with the world. They also added voting and some community stuff to it, but even if it was only a user-generated theme gallery for VS I’d love it. Cool stuff.</p>  <p>Anyway, Luke Sampson (the creator of <a href="http://studiostyles.info/">studiostyles.info</a>) updated <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/10/17/textmate-theme-for-visual-studio-take-2/">Rob’s Vibrant Ink theme</a> for VS2010 and shared it through studiostyles. <strong>Thanks a lot</strong>.</p>  <p>You can find it here: <a href="http://studiostyles.info/schemes/wekeroad-ink">http://studiostyles.info/schemes/wekeroad-ink</a></p>
