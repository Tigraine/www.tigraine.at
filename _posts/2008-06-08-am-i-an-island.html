<p>Due to the fact that most of university of klagenfurt's curriculum is biased towards Java sometimes makes it hard for a .NET developer to be able to go up to someone and say: &quot;Hey, look what I did yesterday&quot;.    <br />Either you just ran into one of those guys who just managed to get the last proprietary driver off his debian-unstable laptop and will chase you down some hallway by even saying the word Microsoft near his ears.     <br />Or you will meet some insensible guy who's not into the study at all but decided that doing computer science after high-school is the right thing because he used to be playing computer a lot (people around here often use their studies as an excuse for not wanting to do real work).     <br />Or there is that honest guy who just focuses on his studies and therefore is stuck in a world of Java :).</p>  <p>So, sometimes I read all those blogs out there from overseas about communities, ALT.NET, open spaces conferences and stuff, and start to feel a little lonely around here in carinthia.    <br />I mean, there are plenty of people I really love to talk about tech, I even sometimes try bend my mind around to talk to some of the hardcore Linux guys around here. But there is nobody to whom I can talk about what I am up to lately (in .NET), nobody who is actually working with .NET (besides me) that I can call up to ask for advice on ... let's say WPF.</p>  <p>So today I decided to throw the words <em>usergroup </em>and <em>Klagenfurt</em> at my Google and I somehow ended up at <a href="http://europe.ineta.org">ineta.org</a>, short for International .NET Association.     <br />After doing their usergroup search for Austria I found out that there ought to be two groups here around Klagenfurt university. Both of which seem to have disbanded (websites down etc).     <br />Now what really struck me was that even the back of beyond (namely Vorarlberg) has a .NET user group, while Vienna and Graz having plenty of them.     <br />Didn't they tell me when I signed up for my study that Klagenfurt is one of the major universities when it comes to computer science?     <br />And now I'd like to know, if Klagenfurt is that good, why we can't have a .NET user group. </p>  <p>So is there an audience for a .NET user group in Klagenfurt? Or do I need to pony up the 60 euros per month for a bus ride and go to Graz if I want to meet like-minded people?   <br />So it boils down to the initial question: <em>Am I an .NET island?</em></p>
