<p>I just booted my PC after 4 hours of drive through heavy rain and thunderstorms back from Vienna where I attended Barcamp. I have to say it was just fantastic! All Barcamps I attended before had a very diverse crowd, but usually lacking developers thus the social media enthusiasts usually dominated the attendees. </p>  <p>Barcamp Vienna was different, maybe it was the awesome location at Microsoft Austria headquarters or just the fact that it was in Vienna.. But I met more coders there in 2 days than in the last 2 yeas in Klagenfurt. </p>  <p>Coolest thing, I even met a <a href="http://www.subsonicproject.com/">Subsonic</a> developer: <a href="http://github.com/saintedlama">Saintedlama</a>! That was really awesome and funny when we met during breakfast randomly chatting about our stuff and I noted that I’ll be <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/2010/05/22/presenting-dotless-at-barcamp-vienna/">presenting dotless</a> when he said: “Wow that’s you? I wanted to contact you for some time now about dotless. I’m working on Subsonic btw.. &quot; (Imagine my jaw dropping right there.. ). He showed me some really cool demos of the simple repository they introduced in SubSonic 3 and it’s uses with MVC.. and I have to tell you: wow.. Using a ORM was really never so easy.. </p>  <p>Anyway, I really had a great time either chatting up really interesting people or doing my two presentations.    <br />On Saturday I talked about <a href="http://wwww.dotlesscsss.com">dotless</a> while on Sunday I talked about <a href="http://git-scm.org">Git</a>. Both talks went great in my opinion, but if anyone was there and has additional feedback on my presentations I’d be glad to hear them. I uploaded both slide decks to <a href="http://www.docs.com">http://www.docs.com</a> and you can find them here:</p>  <p><a href="http://docs.com/17TX"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/image1.png" width="156" height="122" /></a> </p>  <p><a href="http://docs.com/17TX">dotless – CSS done right</a></p>  <p><a href="http://docs.com/17U1"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/image2.png" width="148" height="120" /></a> </p>  <p><a href="http://docs.com/17U1">Git</a></p>  <p>At any rate: Thanks to <a href="http://wissenbelastet.com/">Max</a> and <a href="http://rolfgeneratedcontent.com/">Rolf</a> for organizing this awesome event and to Microsoft for so generously hosting it! </p>
