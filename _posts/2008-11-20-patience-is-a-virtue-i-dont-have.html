<p>I hate waiting for stuff when working. Whenever something hangs, lags or simply doesn’t work right the first time I get annoyed. </p>  <p>Usually a little distraction like this doesn’t really hurt too much, but when you are deep in thought while programming – and something hangs, I can almost feel how my memory gets flushed and my productivity drops to zero for the next few minutes while I try to get back into everything.</p>  <p>This is very very very bad, and that’s why I am feeding insane amounts of money to the hardware vendors. I need the best performance not because of the insane calculations I do but simply because I can’t afford to get distracted by lagging applications.</p>  <p>Same thing applies to unit tests and build processes. It’s important to keep those as short as possible. If I’m doomed to wait for 2 minutes to see if my unit tests pass or not I will either not run them as frequently, or I will run them and do something else in between. Either way I loose productivity.</p>  <p>So, while at it, I guess the server I wanted to configure stopped hanging while I wrote this. </p>
