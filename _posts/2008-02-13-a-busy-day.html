<p>At first I didn't want to post this. I'm completely exhausted after 8 hours of doing training at <a href="http://www.pixelpoint.at">pixelpoint</a> and some computer administration stuff for a friend afterwards. </p>  <p>But, because I talked like 3 hours about the Web 2.0 phenomenon and kept repeating &quot;You should blog&quot; I forced myself into blogging about it.</p>  <p>Although I didn't plan to stay for so long I actually enjoyed the day. I was doing a course on .NET programming in VB.NET and people were very interested and doing very well. Afterwards we had an open discussion (after I showed off some Web 2.0 stuff) about Web 2.0 and how it can be used for various things in the carinthian context.</p>  <p>The Web 2.0 actually got out of hand after we covered <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">WordPress</a> and <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a> in detail and we spent like an hours discussing the pro's and con's of WordPress as a CMS system for smaller web sites.</p>  <p>The programming session was far more enjoyable for myself. I think they actually did learn something from the whole thing, although they are still hesitating to write code themselves (I had to force them into writing a small sample application). But I think they now understand the .NET syntax much better and will be more efficient on doing ASP.NET web sites in the future.</p>
