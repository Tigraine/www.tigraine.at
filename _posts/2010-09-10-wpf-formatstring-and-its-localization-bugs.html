<p>As some of you may know, I am from Austria. That means that I get to pay my bills in Euro and we format our decimals with a comma instead of a period (yes I know I’m weird). </p>  <p>So naturally my culture setting is de-AT and I really expect to see my decimals formatted this way: &euro; 19,99   <br />Turns out, WPF doesn’t give a damn and if you use FormatString in a binding it will just go ahead and return en-US formats!</p>  
{% highlight xml %}
<TextBox Text="{Binding Path=Model.Price, StringFormat=\{0:c\}}"/>

{% endhighlight %}

<p>This is a bug in WPF and has been there for more than 2 years now from what I can gather. There is a <a href="http://www.nbdtech.com/Blog/archive/2009/02/22/wpf-data-binding-cheat-sheet-update-the-internationalization-fix.aspx">fix to it</a> as suggested by <a href="http://twitter.com/nirdobovizki">Nir Dobovizki</a>, who coincidentally also has a pretty cool <a href="http://go.nbdtech.com?94E138EA">CheatSheet on WPF Databinding</a> that I now have taped to the wall.</p>

<p>For the sake of completeness here is the code you have to put in your App startup code (I’ve thrown it in my App constructor):</p>


{% highlight csharp %}
FrameworkElement.LanguageProperty.OverrideMetadata(
    typeof(FrameworkElement), 
    new FrameworkPropertyMetadata(
        XmlLanguage.GetLanguage(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.IetfLanguageTag)));

{% endhighlight %}

<p>While at it I also found out another pretty cool thing that managed to save me a lot of markup in XAML: MultiBinding! You can apply StringFormat to single elements through the {Binding} blocks, but sometimes you want to show stuff like “Showing Page x of y” somewhere. 
  <br />My naïve approach was to just create 4 elements and bind 2 of them to the appropriate values. As <a href="http://elegantcode.com/author/blagunas/">Brian</a> points out in his post on <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2009/04/07/wpf-stringformat-in-xaml-with-the-stringformat-attribute/">WPF StringFormat</a> you can just do stuff like this:</p>


{% highlight xml %}
<TextBlock VerticalAlignment="Center" Margin="0, 0, 0, 10">
    <TextBlock.Text>
        <MultiBinding StringFormat="Showing Page {0} of {1}">
            <Binding Path="CurrentPage" />
            <Binding Path="NumberOfPages" />
        </MultiBinding>
    </TextBlock.Text>
</TextBlock>

{% endhighlight %}

<p>The StringFormat attribute works exactly like the String.Format method whereas the <Binding> children are the parameters passed into it. Pretty cool to say the least. </p>

<p>Now if only someone explained to me why WPF Grids have this hideous way of cluttering up my markup with Grid.Row=”0” Grid.Column=”1” I may finally make my peace with WPF (aka the display technology I stayed away until now because learning it seemed like an impossible task)</p>
