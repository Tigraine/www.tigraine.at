<p>As <a href="http://www.semanticmetadata.net/2008/07/04/games-implementation-week-for-high-school-students/">Mathias</a> has already hinted, today was the final presentation of the ongoing computer games implementation week I was instructing at klagenfurt university. During the last week I and Christian where working together with a small group of 7 high school students (of age 15-17) on some pretty amazing computer games with Microsoft's XNA framework. </p>  <p>We started out with some basic talk about computer games in general and introduced the students to Microsoft XNA on the second day. Most of them had some basic Java experience and absolutely no knowledge of C# or XNA. After pointing out some syntax differences between Java and C# we started with a very <a href="http://creators.xna.com/en-us/tutorial/collision2drectangle">basic boulder game tutorial</a> from the XNA creators club website that should teach <a href="http://creators.xna.com/en-us/tutorial/collision2drectangle">2D rectangle collision detection</a> with XNA. Afterwards the students were asked to expand on this idea and create their own 2D computer game.</p>  <p>And now I am very happy to show some of their great work they did during the last 4 days!</p>  <p>This is where we started out:    <br /><img src="http://creators.xna.com/assets/cms/images/XNA_Collision1_2D_Rectangle_01_small.jpg" /> </p>  <p>And these are screen shots from our student's projects (click to get the full view):</p>  <p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/image2.png"><img border="0" alt="Argon" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/image-thumb2.png" width="240" height="187" /></a> <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/image3.png"><img border="0" alt="Abwechslungsreiche Ein&#246;de" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/image-thumb3.png" width="240" height="187" /></a> <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/image4.png"><img border="0" alt="Block Fighters" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/image-thumb4.png" width="240" height="187" /></a> <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/image5.png"><img border="0" alt="Space Impact" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/image-thumb5.png" width="240" height="187" /></a> <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/image6.png"><img border="0" alt="Sweet Sattelites" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/image-thumb6.png" width="240" height="187" /></a> </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>I also promised Mathias to create videos from the projects that we did so he can show them at future computer games courses, I'll post these videos on YouTube once I've recorded them.    <br />We will also be releasing the games source code, but I am still trying to figure out the license for some of them.</p>  <p>I've had a great time with those talented kids and hope they enjoyed learning as much as I did enjoy teaching!</p>
