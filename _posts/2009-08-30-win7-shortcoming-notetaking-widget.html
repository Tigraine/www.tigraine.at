I said so after installing the first beta for the first time and I’ve been running my new favorite OS ever since.</p>  <p>But I have one problem with the way Microsoft used their built-in applications to showcase new functionality like jump-lists etc: They broke the Notes widget from the Windows sidebar.</p>  <p>You know, that little widget thingy that allowed you to write down 4 short lines somewhere on your screen.</p>  <p>In Windows Vista it was visible whenever your sidebar was visible (not a perfect solution either), but at least it was visible occasionally. </p>  <p>Windows7 changed this, Notes is now it’s own little application that has to run and that takes away space from my task-bar. And: When I use Aero-Peek to look at my desktop widgets, the Notes app turns transparent too. </p>  <p>So, it became nearly useless, since I want my notes to be a gentle, sometimes visible reminder for things I need to keep track of. Nothing I’d start a program to look at, no – something that is just there sometimes. And the new Win7 implementation of that falls seriously short of that goal. (And I very rarely see my desktop except for Win+D or Aero-Peek – both witch also remove the notes from the screen.)</p>  <p>In fact: I wonder why anyone would sacrifice some valuable taskbar real-estate for such a useless application.</p>
