<p>I decided not to invest any work in writing docs for a tool only I am using, due to the fact that it quite rapidly outdates during active development. </p>  <p>Well, <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/category/programmierung/projects/elmsconnector/" target="_blank">ELMS-Connector</a> development is mostly finished and after getting an email by someone from Amsterdam asking how to use ELMS-Connector I decided to finally write the docs. </p>  <p>The documentation is in the <a href="http://github.com/Tigraine/elms-connector" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> alongside the code, but I also <a href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/Tigraine/elms-connector/ELMS_Documentation.pdf" target="_blank">saved it as PDF and uploaded it</a>.</p>  <p>Itâ€™s by no means perfect, but it should be enough to get anyone who wants to use ELMS-Connector up and running quite smoothly. Comments are always welcome.</p>
