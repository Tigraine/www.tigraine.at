<p>I don’t like documentation.    <br />Whenever I feel that I need to add comments to a piece of code to make it understandable I usually rework the code until it’s intent and workings are clear from looking at it.</p>  <p>Still, documentation will come after you once you are dealing with defects and planned features. Nobody can keep that stuff in their head, and it’s important to keep track of what your customers expect you to do/fix.</p>  <p>And while big projects demand some “real” process around this issue, when you’re doing small projects you usually don’t want to break a butterfly upon a wheel.</p>  <p>One easy solution is to simply write a <strong>Unit Test that exposes the bug.</strong>     <br />Whether you fix it right away or you check it into your source-tree is totally up to you, but you’ll always see that red light reminding you of that bug.</p>  <p>While at it, I strongly suggest always writing a Unit Test to expose a bug prior to fixing it. You increase your code coverage by fixing bugs, and protect yourself from having the bug surface again with a later change.</p>  <p>Still, you should also look into getting a “real” bugtracking databases like <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ/">FogBugz</a> (has a <a href="https://shop.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/default.asp?sCategory=HOSTEDFB&amp;sStep=stepEnterEmailAddress&amp;HFBnForm=1">free 2 person license</a>), or install your own like <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> or <a href="http://www.bugnetproject.com/">BugNET</a>.</p>
