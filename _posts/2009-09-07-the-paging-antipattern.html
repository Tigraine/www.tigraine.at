<p>Wherever you look on the internet, everywhere you’ll see pagination. This is especially important in web shop scenarios where you don’t want to overwhelm your user. </p>  <p>Usually you just take these things for granted and use them to navigate around, until you discover a gem of bad design like this one on the German bookstore Thalia:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image1.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image_thumb1.png" width="533" height="173" /></a> </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p>This is a 1:1 screenshot, no scaling from the original. And as usual: the one <tt>&lt;</tt> will take you to the previous page, the <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> will take you to the very first page. </p>  <p>Now, let’s consider these options that are only 3 pixels apart from each other: First page, previous (thus page 4), page 1.    <br />Let’s just assume that unless you are really careful with you mouse you’re looking at a 2/3 chance of finding yourself on page number 1 instead of 4!</p>  <p>Instead of trying to home in on that tiny next button I found myself using the numbers to get to the next page, totally ridiculous. </p>  <p>Upon getting frustrated by this particular eBook store I decided to take a look at the other major players and their pagination solutions.</p>  <p><strong>Amazon:</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image2.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image_thumb2.png" width="293" height="47" /></a> </p>  <p>I just measured a distance of over 40 pixels between the 3 and the Next button. And even on a search where with less than 3 pages they keep a distance of at least 20 pixels between Next and 3. Also important that <em>Next</em> is always last and <em>Previous</em> is first. No First and Last button anywhere to be found.</p>  <p><strong>Google:</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image3.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image_thumb3.png" width="368" height="70" /></a> </p>  <p>Again, hitboxes for <em>Previous</em> and <em>Next</em> are enormous while completely lacking First and Last. </p>  <p></p>  <p><strong>Ebay:</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image4.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image_thumb4.png" width="290" height="56" /></a> </p>  <p><strong>Bing:</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image5.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image_thumb5.png" width="322" height="60" /></a> </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p></p>  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Nobody uses these&#160; Last and First any more. Get over it and leave them out! Why should anyone want to go to the last page of a listing that is probably already sorted by relevancy? </p>  <p>Instead use the space for huge Previous and Next buttons that are far away from any other navigational controls. At any rate, never ever use those &lt;&gt; Symbols alone as you means to navigate, always provide a big enough hitbox to avoid frustration.</p>
