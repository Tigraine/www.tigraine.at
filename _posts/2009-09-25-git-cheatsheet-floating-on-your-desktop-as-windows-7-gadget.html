<p>While browsing a bit through the <a href="http://github.com/guides/git-cheat-sheet">GitHub guides section</a> I noticed a wonderful git cheat sheet that outlines the most used commands with some basic usage instructions <a href="http://zrusin.blogspot.com/2007/09/git-cheat-sheet.html">created by Zack Rusin</a>. </p>  <p>I have a love/hate relationship with cheat sheets because most of the time I print them and then they usually merge with all the trash that’s laying around my desk so I hardly ever get to use them (except for when I really need them and they are laying face down below my mouse pad). </p>  <p>So the obvious place for that sheet would be my secondary monitor so I can refer to it when needed. Only problem here is that I really don’t want to run a browser window all the time just to see a cheat sheet, and setting it as my wallpaper would mean no more beautiful images changing every 10 minutes (I love Win7 for this!). </p>  <p>Now, what is between your applications and your desktop? Right: Windows gadgets.</p>  <p>By following the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/aa965850(en-us,VS.85).aspx">guide from the Microsoft developer center</a> I very quickly ended up with a quite nice gadget that now beautifully floats above my desktop with all the common used git commands I need to check while scratching my head (dementia I hate you). </p>  <p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image9.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image_thumb7.png" width="644" height="425" /></a> </p>  <p>Pair this with the awesome Aero Peek at the desktop from Windows 7 (if you hit Win+Space all Windows become glass and you see your gadgets + desktop), and you can quickly glance at the cheat sheet without having to run any application or change your wallpaper. And if I don’t feel like doing git I just close the gadget with one click.</p>  <p>As said above, the cheat sheet is done by Zack Rusin. Thanks for this gem! The code for the gadget and the download is on GitHub and is licensed under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">ASL-2</a> (yeah I like that license a lot).</p>  <p>The GitHub repository is at: <a href="http://github.com/Tigraine/git-cheatsheet-gadget">http://github.com/Tigraine/git-cheatsheet-gadget</a></p>  <p>And to just download the gadget hit the <a href="http://github.com/Tigraine/git-cheatsheet-gadget/downloads">downloads section within GitHub</a> (or <a href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/Tigraine/git-cheatsheet-gadget/git-cheatsheet.gadget">directly</a>)</p>  <p>Oh and please excuse if GitHub is down sometimes right now. They are in the process of <a href="http://github.com/blog/497-rackspace-move-scheduled-for-sunday-september-27th-at-5pm-pacific-time">moving their servers to a new hoster</a> and hopefully they will be reliably back up by Monday. </p>
