<p>I hate web development, I learned to hate it when I was translating Photoshop designs into XHTML years ago and I was really hoping to never do it again. </p>  <p>Unfortunately, most people who took the <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/2009/07/03/new-imagineclub-website-design-poll/">iC Website design</a> survey really liked the new design, so I decided to start working to get this thing done sometime soon. Here is the poll result:</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image4.png" width="362" height="220" /> </p>  <p>Thanks again to all who participated! </p>  <p>So, where are we? First: I am developing the iC website in the open. The source code is available at the <a href="http://bitbucket.org/Tigraine/ic-website/">project’s BitBucket site</a>, so if you want to see what progress has been made just follow the <a href="http://bitbucket.org/Tigraine/ic-website/atom/">project’s commit history RSS</a>. </p>  <p>Sadly, Currently the repository is more or less a blank MonoRail template while I am trying to get the XHTML to look like <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/2009/07/03/new-imagineclub-website-design-poll/">Kristof’s design</a>. I am really trying hard to maintain a clean markup to enable accessibility to all users. </p>  <p>Unfortunately, my CSS skills are somewhat lacking, so I had to learn the hard way that background-position won’t work with background-repeat, and that there is no chance in hell we’ll ever support IE6. </p>  <p>I’m also not sure yet on what license the project should use. I slashed a APL2 license on it just to have one, but I guess we’ll drop that in favor of a CC license.</p>
