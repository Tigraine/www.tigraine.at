<p>Although I am still actively working for Pixelpoint, running strong on finishing my projects, I also went back to Klagenfurt University to finally finish my computer science bachelor degree.</p>  <p>Only problem being that (since I am now caught up somewhere between work and university) I can’t fit any lectures into my schedule. I can barely attain courses that require me to do so, so lecture slides are a rather vital part of my studying right now, and not being able to access them is really a showstopper.</p>  <p>What really bothers me is that a university professor who is teaching computer science, doesn’t get the concept of an open exchange of information and knowledge! </p>  <p>All educational material for courses by the <a href="http://www.syssec.at/">syssec</a> group is accessible through an external website that is password protected and where username/password combination is only given out during lectures.</p>  <p><strong>Why</strong>?</p>  <p>We are talking about slides for a university lecture, by Austrian law a public event that anyone can attain (yes! every person who wishes to can simply sit in there and listen). Anyone who wants to can simply walk into the <a href="http://www.oeh.ac.at/">ÖH</a> office and can buy a printed copy of exactly those slides for less than 1&euro;. Heck, everyone can get to those slides anyway so why are we keeping people out?</p>  <p>I’ve seen them, there are no state secrets in there. To be honest: I don’t even like these slides too much (they were meant to be presented by a professor mind you). Still they are a valuable source of information that I believe shouldn’t be kept away from anyone.</p>  <p>On the other hand there is <a href="http://www-itec.uni-klu.ac.at/~laszlo/">O. Univ.-Prof. Dipl.-Ing. Dr. Laszlo Böszörmenyi</a> who manages to somehow have <strong>ALL</strong> of his course material be publicly (and freely) available to anyone. So, I doubt there is any legal reasoning behind locking away the course material and I demand that those password protections for the lecture slides are released. A university ought to be a place where knowledge is shared, so why stop at the boundary of a small institution like the University of Klagenfurt? </p>
