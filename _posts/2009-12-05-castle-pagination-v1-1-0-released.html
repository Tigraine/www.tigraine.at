<p>Finally the Castle.Pagination component has reached v1.1.0 and is ready to be incorporated into the upcoming Castle Monorail 2.0 release. </p>  <p>As for the changes: There are hardly any. Pagination is a solved problem and most of the code changes where bug fixes and minor improvements. </p>  <p>Anyway, thanks Jonathan Rossi for helping me with the release! I can’t wait for Castle to move to GitHub so we can finally put that whole “non-committer sends patches” misery behind us.</p>
