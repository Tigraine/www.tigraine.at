<p>It’s been on our feature list for some time and it’s been in the code for some time too. But after fixing a final bug today I guess we can tell the world about it. </p>  <p>The main idea behind –watch is to free you of the burden of having to configure anything but lets you just run the console-compiler once and it keeps refreshing the resulting .css files whenever a change occurs to the .less input file. </p>  <p>How to use? Well, simple. First grab the latest release from our website <a href="http://www.dotlesscss.com">http://www.dotlesscss.com</a> and then go to your favorite commandline and start the compiler with the –watch parameter:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><tt>dotless.Compiler.exe &lt;filename&gt; –watch</tt></p> </blockquote>  <p>You will then get a nice console output telling you what is going on (and informing you of errors if any happen during compilation)</p>  <p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/image.png" width="473" height="169" /></p>
