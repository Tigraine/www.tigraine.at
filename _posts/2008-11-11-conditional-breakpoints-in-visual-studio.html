<p>Sometimes you do something and you never really think about what you’re doing.    <br />Like the following code:</p>  
{% highlight csharp %}
public bool TestSomething(bool input)
{
    if (input == true)
    {
        return true;
    }
    else
    {
        return false;
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>It’s so obvious, I never thought about what I was really doing there, let alone seen the mistake I made. I mean, without any knowledge about boolean evaluation you still should figure out how to get rid of the bracket porn and produce something like this:</p>


{% highlight csharp %}
public bool TestSomething(bool input)
{
    if (input == true)
        return true;
    return false;
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>But that’s only syntactic, the whole statement itself is still silly. The whole <em>== true</em> is completely redundant because you already check a boolean condition to evaluate it to a boolean. 

  <br />So it boils down to:</p>


{% highlight csharp %}
public bool TestSomething(bool input)
{
    return input;
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>And that’s it. You just saved yourself 6 lines of code that where completely useless (<strike>and I guess the compiler is smart enough to optimize that anyway</strike>  <strong>Update: </strong>actually, this does make a difference. The compiler <strong>can’t </strong>figure this out and will produce more IL code because of this).</p>

<p>But once I did this I felt I lack the ability to put a breakpoint on the <em>return false </em>statement. And I eventually may have thought about going back to solution #2. But then I found this little thing in Visual Studio that made my day (and all major IDEs have that, only they hide it well):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/image2.png"><img style="display: inline" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/image-thumb.png" width="240" height="109" /></a> </p>

<p>When you right click a breakpoint you can add a <strong>Condition</strong> to it, so it will only break when that condition is met. I did so, and voila:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/image3.png"><img style="display: inline" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/image-thumb1.png" width="494" height="229" /></a> </p>

<p></p>

<p>Without having to degrade my code I still could break only when false was returned. 
  <br />So when I ran it the first break was in the third call:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/image4.png"><img style="display: inline" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/image-thumb2.png" width="572" height="302" /></a></p>

<p>So, thank god for such great tools like Visual Studio and ReSharper (R# hinted to me that I was doing something stupid in the first place)!</p>
