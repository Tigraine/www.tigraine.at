<p>I guess my laptop is officially broken. I am currently digging for my Dell Support CDs to reinstall Vista on it, but I don’t really think that will help at all(except with the Dell support people).</p>  <p>I do credit the crashes to my hardware simply because I’ve been a Vista user on multiple machines since day 1 and <u>know</u> how rock solid the OS really is.     <br />I suspect the mainboard of my laptop to be faulty in some way.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image-thumb.png" width="780" height="272" /></a> </p>  <p>The funny thing is (besides that my laptop fails to boot 50% of the time), I am still doing active development on that machine.    <br />It works, I see some weird errors sometimes, but I can still work normally on the system once it’s booted. </p>
