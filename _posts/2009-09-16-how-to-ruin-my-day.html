<p>In case you are somewhere stuck in a plan on how to make my day miserable I’ve got a tip for you: </p>  <p>Write absolutely horrible code like this and leave the maintenance to me:</p>  <p>Method signature:</p>  <div class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent" id="scid:2e6d557b-b705-4c34-b5ad-8606cf99c7de:ba05543b-a89e-4f8a-b348-df828fedd846" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><pre name="code" class="csharp">
internal void TryRequestSession(string securityToken, ref Guid secID)
</pre></div>

<p>Call site:</p>

<div class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent" id="scid:2e6d557b-b705-4c34-b5ad-8606cf99c7de:b42afe73-b6ca-4621-8d69-d34e3f9bc336" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><pre name="code" class="csharp">
public ActionMethod Open(string securityToken)
{
	Guid secID = Guid.Empty;
	try
	{
		secID = new Guid(securityToken);
	}
	catch
	{}
	Guid oldSecID = secID;
	provider.TryRequestSession(securityToken, ref secID);
	if (oldSecID == Guid.Empty)
	//....
}
</pre></div>

<p>There are many things wrong with this code, but I’ll spare you the details and say that new Guid(securityToken) will <u>always</u> throw a ArgumentException and that I have absolutely no tolerance for void methods that have ref parameters! 

  <br />Whatever was going on in that chimps mind who wrote that, it couldn’t have anything to do with programming.</p>

<p>So, recap: If you expect other people to maintain your code (I’m currently rewriting this thing, it’s easier) make sure you do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Have Unit tests that specify the behavior</li>

  <li>Leave an actual spec that can be looked at</li>

  <li>NEVER use ref if you can use return</li>

  <li>Don’t swallow exceptions (and if you have to, leave a comment!)</li>

  <li>Make it run!</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes that’s right. If you leave a piece of crap behind, at least make it compile! I had to search for 3 totally outdated libraries to even make this piece of junk compile on my machine. Again: <u><strong>The GAC is your enemy!</strong></u></p>

<p>Thank you, you now may go on with your lives while I feel a lot better and my actually start enjoying my coffee :)</p>
