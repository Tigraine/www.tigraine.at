<p>I’m a keyboard addict. I love keyboards and they love me.    <br />I never managed to break one in any way because I have never used one long enough to break it. I consider my keyboard the most important tool as a programmer, and that’s why I constantly try to get the best available. </p>  <p>I guess that is over, I haven’t bought a new keyboard for over a year now. </p>  <p>My last 3 keyboard buys have all been the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=043">Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000</a> so I have one for every workplace I happen to be at. My 2 computers at home have one, my desk at work has one, it’s just that great!</p>  <p><img title="mk_otherviews_nek4k_01" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="176" alt="mk_otherviews_nek4k_01" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mk-otherviews-nek4k-01.jpg" width="277" border="0" /> </p>  <p>I got introduced to Ergonomic keyboards through the Logitech Ergonomic Desktop Freedom Pro (or at least I think it was called that way) and used it long enough to really learn how to properly type. It was good compared to what I was using before (10 pound IBM bricks) and it was the first keyboard I actually bought myself (for the ridiculous amount of 280&euro; as a 16 year old). Unfortunately Logitech discontinued the ergo series and Microsoft’s old Natural keyboard was discontinued too so I switched back to normal keyboards for quite some time (trying out all sorts of fancy keyboards like the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/info/product.aspx?view=22&amp;pcid=ca22bf27-b18c-4084-b0e9-85b9e42e826a&amp;type=ovr">Fingerprint Keyboard</a> etc) before I found the Microsoft Natural 4000. </p>  <p>At that point I haven’t used a ergonomic keyboard for some years so I was hesitant, but I got lured by the price. 40&euro; is nothing after having spent 100&euro; on the Logitech G15 (worst keyboard ever) and I was blown away by what I got!</p>  <p>Typing is so convenient on this keyboard, and my wrists feel a lot better after extended periods of work than they did before on the (ergonomic nightmare) G15 (we’re talking about magnitudes of &gt;300% here).    <br />The leather I rest my wrists on feels very comfortable and soft even after a year of extensive use.</p>  <p>The keyboard also comes with some sort of tilt-attachment that creates a reverse slope. It’s unusable if you want to play games, but for typing it is very comfortable to not have to bend your wrist to access keys.</p>  <p>Also notable is that the keyboard comes with a standard pgup/pgdown layout instead what makes working pretty easy once again (who designed the DELL keyboards should be crucified for the Pos1/End placement!).</p>  <p>Some shortcomings: </p>  <ul>   <li>No Next/Previous Media functionality. Only Play/Pause and Volume control buttons.</li>    <li>No lock workstation button, I had to remap my Calculator key</li>    <li>Zoom wheel in the middle of the keyboard is pretty much useless.</li> </ul>  <p>Still, the best keyboard you can get.</p>
