<p>I feel like I’m constantly falling behind on stuff I want to post about but don’t get around to. One of which is the version control system Mercurial I have been using now for almost 4 months and loving ever since.    <br />Since Google just decided to enable <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/05/support-for-mercurial-now-available-for.html">Mercurial on Google Code</a> I figured it’s a great time to write about it.</p>  <p>What is Mercurial?    <br />I’ll quote the <a href="http://bitbucket.org/help/GettingStartedWithMercurial">getting started article</a> from Bitbucket:</p>  <blockquote>   <h5>Introduction</h5>    <p>Mercurial is a distributed version control system, or DVCS for short. It is in the ranks of Git and Bazaar, leading a new paradigm of working with version control.</p> </blockquote>  <blockquote>   <h5>Philosophy</h5>    <p>This new paradigm of distributed versioning allows for several things that centralized development does not. Specifically, it provides:</p>    <ol>     <li>Allows commits/logs even when working offline </li>      <li>Drastic increase in speed for most operations </li>      <li>Ability for anyone to have their own copy of a project, and continue work without explicit &quot;commit access&quot; </li>      <li>No requirement to publish changes </li>      <li>No need to set up a server for version controlling things (self-contained) </li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>So, it’s like your&#160; own private version control system. Nobody can mess with it, you own it.    <br />Which is great, I mean: How often has a fellow coworker submitted something to your tree that made your code break? Or how often did you update before a commit just to see that the update breaks something (and your changes weren’t commited, so you’re at the mercy of merges)?</p>  <p>What also rocks is it’s simplicity. Mercurial needs no server, so even on my little pet projects I can leverage the power of a SCM system without the headache around setting up something in a central place. </p>  <p>What most people though fail to understand is that the centralized model does also mean that you need to share your private changes with the world at some time.    <br />And while doing so on a shared filesystem is very easy (when sharing with a coworker for example), doing so over the wire is non-trivial as it would require you setting up a server somewhere. </p>  <p>And that’s how I learned to love <a href="http://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Bitbucket's aim is to compensate for this while maintaining the flexibility and benefits of DVCS. It does this firstly by providing a centralized location for a repository which provides a sharing-point for one or more developers to grow their code base. Secondly, it provides a set of tools that ease development and sharing of a code with the rest of the world.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Bitbucket is free and gives you <u>150mb of disk space</u>, an <u>issue tracker</u> and a <u>wiki</u> for each of your projects. While the limitation is that only one project/repository per account can be private (not open source), there is no limit on how many public repositories you can create.</p>  <p>I suggest reading the <a href="http://bitbucket.org/help/GettingStartedWithMercurial">guides</a> on Bitbucket (<a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/">or the book</a>) on how HG differs from SVN and how the usual workflow looks like.     <br />Also I suggest installing TortoiseHg, this will install all the hg command-line as well as a nice shell integrated GUI like we are all used to from TortoiseSVN.</p>
