<p>Wow! Scott Guthrie just <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/01/16/net-framework-library-source-code-now-available.aspx" target="_blank">announced on his blog</a> that the source servers are ready and that they just released most of their .NET source code to the public.</p>  <p>This means that you are able to download the debug symbols and actually debug the .NET classes if you want to. Or you can just drool over the framework and try to learn a thing or two.</p>  <p>Go check out Shawn Burke's blog post about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2008/01/16/configuring-visual-studio-to-debug-net-framework-source-code.aspx" target="_blank">how to set things up</a>.</p>
