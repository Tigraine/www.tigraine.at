<p>I needed one simple thing: Delete all .svn folders from a repository so I can send it to my customer. While searching most of the results I got where either wrong, or completely besides the point, so I decided it may be worth sharing:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><tt>get-childitem -Include .svn -Recurse -force | Remove-Item -Force â€“Recurse</tt></p></blockquote>
