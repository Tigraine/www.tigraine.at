<p>After some thought I finally dragged myself to make a decision on the <a href="http://del.icio.us/Tigraine">del.icio.us links</a> in my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Tigraine">RSS feed</a>:</p>  <p>I finally decided to remove the links from the feed, most of my del.icio.us links aren't just that relevant to my blog posts that I really need to share them with you.    <br />If you still want to recieve my del.icio.us links you can simply subscribe to my <a href="http://feeds.delicious.com/rss/Tigraine">del.icio.us feed</a> or add me to your network in del.icio.us.     <br />Another way to stay informed on my del.icio.us (and all my other activities, wether you like it or not *gg*) would be to simply follow me on <a href="http://friendfeed.com/tigraine">friendfeed</a> (although I still haven't really grasped the concept of the site).</p>  <p>Hope the feed just got more enjoyable for you :)</p>  <p>Cheers!</p>
