<p>I know I haven't posted for some time, mainly due to the fact that I'm in the middle of exams right now. </p>  <p>While I should be learning Computer Organization &amp; Design for next week's exams (besides some other stuff I should be doing right now), I started off reading my new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201456007&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction by Steve McConnell</a>.</p>  <p>While I'm not fully happy with Amazon's delivery (a week late, both books got damaged during the lift), I am very happy with the book itself. Unfortunately it isn't that easy to read, so due to a lack of piece and quiet I haven't read past chapter 4. </p>  <p>McConnell laid out in his first chapter that real Software Development Ideas won't be addressed before chapter 5, so I was pretty much reading through common problems during project inception and the differences between sequential and iterative programming.</p>  <p>Besides reading and learning I also started some ASP.NET MVC experiments, but I think I'll back up on that for now and try to make myself familiar with the pattern behind MVC.</p>
