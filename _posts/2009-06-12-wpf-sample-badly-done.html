<p>While trying out some WPF, I ended up downloading <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb295243.aspx">this code sample on Drag&amp;Drop</a> that contained the following piece  of code:</p>  
{% highlight csharp %}
if (e.Source == MyCanvas)
{
}
else
{
    _isDown = true;
    _startPoint = e.GetPosition(MyCanvas);
    _originalElement = e.Source as UIElement;
    MyCanvas.CaptureMouse();
    e.Handled = true;
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Come on? Iâ€™ve seen 6 year olds that knew the use of != and ==.</p>

<p>Please Microsoft: <u>Documentation is as important as shipping code</u>. At least review what crap is getting put out there. It just looks bad to say the least. </p>
