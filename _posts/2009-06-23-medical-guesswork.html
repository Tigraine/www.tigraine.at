After examining her for some time he said:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Could be [<a href="http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/2750.html">weird desease that involves necrosis inside the joint</a>], let’s run some tests.</p> </blockquote>  <p>And off she went with an appointment 2 weeks down the road, waiting for the tests to prove that she has a necrotic bone inside her right wrist. </p>  <p>At 21 you don’t take such things very lightly (especially if they involve permanent damage to the right hand), and those two weeks of waiting for the “real thing&quot; proved to be quite stressful for her. Thank god the tests came back and proved that the pain was caused by something else!</p>  <p>Now, fast forward one month, I went to see the same doctor because I felt pain in my left wrist over the last week. After doing a 3 minute examination (if you want to call some touching my wrist that way) he said:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><font style="background-color: #ffffff">Could be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome">carpal tunnel</a>, otherwise the wrist looks fine. Let’s run some more tests.</font></p> </blockquote>  <p>He then gave me the number of 3 other doctors to go to and run tests, to find out if I’ve really got carpal tunnel.</p>  <p>Guess what? I don’t care. I won’t go to see any of those and I certainly won’t ever go back to see that one again. </p>  <p>Why? Simple: I’m a programmer, my wrists are a very very valuable thing to me. I just wanted to make sure that everything is ok, not embark on a 3 week roundtrip to 3 doctors with the thought in mind “This CTS thing could ruin my life”. (And the pain was really just a small annoyance I wanted to get checked out, nowhere near actual pain)</p>  <p>Seriously? What doctor tells his 21/24 year old patient his “first guess” at a diagnosis? Especially such a bad one? Do I walk around my customers and tell them “Hey, from the look of the app I get the impression this codebase is unrecoverable, I’ll run some analysis but prepare to pay for a rewrite.”? </p>  <p>I guess you have figured out that I’m slightly annoyed right now. But rest assured that I am currently at perfect health. If my wrist-pain comes back I’ll see a (better) doctor – I promise.</p>
