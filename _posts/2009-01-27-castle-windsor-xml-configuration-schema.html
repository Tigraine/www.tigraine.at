<p>While creating a Windsor XML configuration for a new project today I found myself looking too much at the reference to get started. I figured this may be because of the lack of a schema that would provide me Intellisense in Visual Studio. Shockingly I couldn’t find a xsd schema file for the Windsor configuration. </p>  <p>I then looked at some w3schools tutorials and figured out how to do a xsd schema myself and tried to remodel the <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/container/documentation/trunk/manual/windsorconfigref.html">Windsor configuration reference</a>.</p>  <p>You can grab the xsd schema file here: <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/windsor-configuration.xsd">windsor-configuration.xsd</a></p>  <p>I’ll post a little tutorial on how to load it inside Visual Studio later.</p>
