<p>Imagine my face when I got the following screen while logging into Gmail in the morning:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image14.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image-thumb10.png" width="563" height="217" /></a> </p>  <p>Chrome really suggested that <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> has no valid SSL certificate and may be dangerous.     <br />Also services like Windows Live Messenger and Windows Update refused to work due to broken SSL certificates. </p>  <p>Turns out, I accidentally set the system clock after a bios reset to 28. July 2008 instead of 2009. I guess I looked at the system time about 3 times before noticing the error :(. </p>  <p>Funny: The wrong year also prevented me from syncing the time with time.windows.com to get to the right one. </p>
