<p>So, yesterday I noticed something funny while doing some data-driven ASP.NET programming.</p>  <p>There are those really great Validation controls that really reduce the amount of code you need to write on average input forms.</p>  <p>So, imagine you have quite usual code like this:</p>  
{% highlight html %}
<asp:TextBox runat="server" ID="MyTextbox"></asp:TextBox><br />
<asp:RequiredFieldValidator ControlToValidate="MyTextbox" runat="server"><br />
    Textbox shouldn't be empty
</asp:RequiredFieldValidator>

<asp:Button runat="server" Text="Submit" OnClick="Submit_Click" />
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This will result in a simple form with a textbox and a submit button. The handler code for the button looks like this:</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
public void Submit_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.Title = "Hello World";
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now, if you click on the button while leaving the textbox blank, you'll see the red message that the field needs to be filled.</p>

<p>If you disable Javascript in your browser, the handler code will get executed without getting validated!</p>

<p>Actually, the validation is done solely on the client if you don't manually check for the Page.isValid property on the Webform.</p>

<p>So, here is the revised handler code:</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
public void Submit_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (this.IsValid)
    {
        this.Title = "Hello World";
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This isn't something unknown, MSDN points it out on some occasions. But yet, something you might overlook too easily.</p>

<p>Keep this in mind when working with validator controls, hope this helps!</p>
