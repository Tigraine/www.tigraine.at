<p>I'm still in the process of doing some research on the tools I'm going to use over the next weeks to build the <a href="http://www.pizza.at">Pizza.at</a> web app.     <br />So today I tried some LinQ to SQL so I can get used to it a bit. And while doing so I started out with reading through ScottGu's <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/09/07/linq-to-sql-part-9-using-a-custom-linq-expression-with-the-lt-asp-linqdatasource-gt-control.aspx">LinQ to SQL series</a>.</p>  <p>I had already some parts of the database schema in place and so I imported it to the ORM, giving me the following model:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/linq1.jpg"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="329" alt="linq1" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/linq1-thumb.jpg" width="435" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>So, this all worked perfectly and I immediately started doing some select statements (while learning how to use and write Lambda expressions - I'll blog about this later).</p>  <p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/linq2.jpg"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="41" alt="linq2" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/linq2-thumb.jpg" width="394" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>And yippie! It worked, although I was very confused that this statement would return a InvalidOperationException in case the Lambda didn't return something. Although I like the fact that it returns an exception, I think the exception given here is too generic. They could have done better in giving the exception a stronger name.</p>  <p>But, after getting over the exception name, everything went smooth from there. Except for me not seeing one thing:   <br />The C and D in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create%2C_read%2C_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>!</p>  <p>ScottGu showed off in his series that doing a simple Categories.Add and an afterwards call to dbContext.SubmitChanges() should do.    <br />In my version of Visual Studio and LinQ I simply don't find this method. All lists I get from the ORM are IQueryable and don't incorporate any Add and Delete Methods.</p>  <p>I'm getting a bit confused, I must be missing something at this point, there must be something I have overlooked. Any thoughts?</p>
