<p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/wordpress.jpg"><img border="0" alt="wordpress" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/wordpress-thumb.jpg" width="186" height="52" /></a></p>  <p>After doing yesterday's post on CruiseControl.NET it bit me that I really really needed a new theme for my blog. Posting sourcecode on a constrained surface doesn't really work, and after seeing the XML posted yesterday I decided I need to do something about it.</p>  <p>So I went to <a href="http://themes.wordpress.net">themes.wordpress.net</a> and found the theme you are currently looking at. It's nothing really special, but I like the clean look and it has no fixed width. The theme came with no widget support so I followed this <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/2007/05/17/enabling-sidebar-widgets-for-your-wordpress-theme/">handy guide</a> and hacked them into the theme myself. It really isn't that hard after all, although I found this php-html mix quite disturbing.</p>  <p>After being done with the new design, I decided that source is horribly unreadable, and I'm not really happy with my previous solution of doing screenshots (not indexable, not copyable). So I found this really cool <a href="http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/">JavaScript library</a> by Alex Gorbatchev called SyntaxHighlighter that highlights &lt;pre&gt; tags and adds some very nice formatting to your code.     <br />Here's an example:</p>  <pre name="code" class="c-sharp">static class Program
  <br />&#160;&#160;&#160; {
  <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; /// &lt;summary&gt;
  <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; /// The main entry point for the application.
  <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; /// &lt;/summary&gt;
  <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; [STAThread]
  <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; static void Main()
  <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; {
  <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Application.EnableVisualStyles();
  <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
  <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Application.Run(new Form1());
  <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; }
  <br />&#160;&#160;&#160; }</pre>

<p>
  <br />And while being at it I also updated to the most current version of WordPress. So if you encounter any oddities (especially with the feed), please tell me about it so I can fix it.</p>

<p>Oh and by the way, while being at it I installed <a href="http://iwphone.contentrobot.com/">iWPhone</a> so that any user who visits <a href="http://tigraine.at">http://tigraine.at</a> with an iPhone or iPod touch will get a stripped down site without too much clutter that's been optimized for the iPhone resolution. Images get removed from the front-page but everything still looks cool. :)</p>
