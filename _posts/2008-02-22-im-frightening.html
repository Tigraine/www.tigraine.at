<p>Today I really scared the hell out of my co-workers.   <br />Although I don't officially work for pixelpoint I am currently working at their office, and so my fellow co-workers had to witness one of my scarce &quot;I jump up and dance through the room in ecstasy because it works&quot; moments.     <br />No need to say that they where completely shocked and came running with water and tranquilizers :).</p>  <p>Why I am a full of joy currently is because my first prototype of my online food-ordering application works!    <br />I was fighting the whole day with validation and data-binding issues on ASP.NET and finally got it to work.</p>  <p>I'll blog on my experiences with LinQ2SQL and ASP.NET in the future. For now I'll just say that I am very very happy with LinQ2SQL and I am absolutely sure that it saved me almost 3 weeks of development. </p>  <p>The whole application is completely functional after 7 days of development (still lacking a GUI)! I mean, obviously you need to be a programmer to order a pizza through the exposed model, but shopping cart, order checkout and product view functionality is already there. </p>  <p>I will spend next week working on a admin application and meeting with the design guys to get the front-end out.</p>
