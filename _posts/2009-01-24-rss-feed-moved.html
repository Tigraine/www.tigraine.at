<p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; display: inline" title="logo_footer" border="0" alt="logo_footer" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/logo-footer.gif" width="132" height="32" /> </p>  <p>So, apparently Google has decided to finally get rid of Feedburner and moved their services over to new servers.&#160; <br />That means new feed URLs for everyone, also for me.</p>  <p>The new Feed URL is: <a href="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/Tigraine">http://feeds2.feedburner.com/Tigraine</a></p>  <p>I changed the little subscribe button to the right, and Google has also put redirects on the old URL pointing to the new one. So, existing subscribers shouldnâ€™t see any change.</p>  <p>Since I already moved (not the smartest thing), if you can read this in your reader, everything is fine.</p>
