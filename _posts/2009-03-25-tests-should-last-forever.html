<p>There is one excellent point <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/">Roy Osherove</a> made while <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2009/03/20/test-review-1-nerddinner.aspx">reviewing the tests</a> in NerdDinner.com I wanted to share with you.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Don’t write tests that change over time!</p> </blockquote>  <p>Often I have initialized objects for tests like this:</p>  <p>   <div class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent" id="scid:2e6d557b-b705-4c34-b5ad-8606cf99c7de:31a42ac3-3110-44bc-ab92-9117f140af90" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><pre name="code" class="csharp">
[Fact]
public void Test()
{
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;DateTime date = DateTime.Now;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;...
}
</pre></div>
</p>

<p>Until recently I thought that’s cool, after all the tests passed every time I ran them.</p>

<p>But what if the passing tests are just a coincidence?
  <br />What if I am testing a financial application that will only accept orders between 8am and 6pm on weekdays, and the order-date gets initialized to DateTime.Now in my test?

  <br />Given the normal work days in most countries that code would run for most developers just fine, but when some notorious late-worker like me comes in the tests start failing for no apparent reason.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Time or place of execution, should not have an impact on a test at all. Given the same code and the same test, the result should always be the same.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, whenever you initialize a value to something from your current execution context (time being the prime example here), you create a possibility that this test will break in some unexpected ways over time. </p>

<p>So if you really want to fill some DateTime with a value for testing use a constant (like DateTime.MinValue/MaxValue). So whenever you re-run this test all inputs are the same as they have been when you wrote the test.</p>
