I guess this screen will look really odd to non-programmers using the awesome Twitter client <a href="http://www.thirteen23.com/experiences/desktop/blu/">blu</a>:

<img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/image1.png" border="0" alt="image" width="349" height="260" />

The text in the box says:
<blockquote>The value for a Int32 was too big or too small.</blockquote>
Any programmer knows this can only mean: Twitter just surpassed the boundaries of a 32 bit signed integer with their Tweed ids and has rendered a number of Twitter clients useless without an update.

Oh, and we all knew this is coming, thanks to <a href="http://www.twitpocalypse.com/">http://www.twitpocalypse.com/</a>
