<p>Although we all love the Windows Installer, sometimes it can give you a really hard time when it breaks (it does rarely, but it does).</p>  <p>That's the time when you need the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301/">Windows Installer Clean Up</a> tool that will remove all install related information from your database so you can start over with the install.</p>  <p>I strongly advice not to use this tool for software that's properly installed. You'll have to clean registry/filesystem by hand if you delete the installer information. It's only really helpful to remove stuff you may have already deleted on the filesystem or to recover from a broken install.</p>  <p>You can download the Windows Installer Clean Up <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301/">here</a>, make sure to run it as administrator (Vista won't prompt you, it will just fail).</p>
