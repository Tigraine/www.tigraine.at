<p>Sometimes you have existing code you don't want to change. And sometimes you need to write libraries that consume these old legacy objects as input to function.    <br />No need to say that it's usually a bad idea to couple your code to not properly tested and poorly designed legacy code.</p>  <p>So it's generally a good idea to abstract it away from new code and try to mask the old objects through adapters and interfaces from being too tightly coupled to your new code.</p>  <p>Either way, you're trying to put square blocks into round holes. And the adapter classes need to be initialized by your callers every time your class gets used.</p>  

{% highlight csharp %}
public class LegacyFoo
{
	public void SomeFoo()
	{}
}
public interface IFoo
{
	void Foo();
}
public class FooAdapter : IFoo
{
	private readonly LegacyFoo Foo_;
	public FooAdapter(LegacyFoo foo)
	{
		Foo_ = foo; }
	public void Foo()
	{ Foo_.SomeFoo(); }
}
public class FooConsumer
{
	public void DoSomethingWithOldFoo(IFoo oldFoo)
	{ oldFoo.Foo(); }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>So instead of providing yet another Factory that constructs the adapter object, you could instead just put the factory method onto the legacy object by using an extension method:</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
public static class FooExtensions
{
	public static IFoo GetFooAdapter(this LegacyFoo foo)
	{ return new FooAdapter(foo); }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now your callers can conveniently construct the Adapter object by calling: </p>

{% highlight csharp %}
LegacyFoo foo = new LegacyFoo();
foo.GetFooAdapter()
{% endhighlight %}
