<p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/delicious.png"><img style="float: left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 15px" border="0" alt="delicious" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/delicious-thumb.png" width="45" height="46" /></a> I have been using feedburner for a pretty long time now, and one thing I thought is particularly handy is that you can let it incorporate your del.icio.us bookmarks into the feed as daily updates.     <br />This removed the necessity of doing a blog post every week that boils down to a link-collection of the most interesting stuff I read across the web that week.</p>  <p>So the main thing is that due to the great Firefox3 Addon for del.icio.us I started to use del.icio.us more and more as a bookmark tool, so that I am &quot;polluting&quot; my feed with sometimes unnecessary stuff that you may or may not be interested in. This has led to the fact that sometimes there are 3-4 link flares from del.icio.us in between 2 of my blog posts. </p>  <p>So this is one question to my dear feed-subscribers: Should I remove my del.icio.us link splicer from my feed?</p>  <p>Ps: By the way, if you are using del.icio.us too and want to add me to your network feel free to do so through my <a href="http://del.icio.us/Tigraine">profile</a>, oh, and if you aren't already subscribed to the feed. You can find it easily to the right or through <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Tigraine">this link</a>.</p>
