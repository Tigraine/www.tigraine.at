<a href="http://www.feedburner.com"><img border="0" width="166" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/feedburner.jpg" alt="feedburner" height="56" style="border-width: 0px" /></a>

One thing that was on my checklist for some months now was getting my RSS Syndication right.

I was thinking about using Feedburner before, but stuck to the Wordpress default Syndication, believing that the Wordpress built-in Feed could do just as good.

I was obviously wrong and finally corrected this mistake today and did set up my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Tigraine">new FeedBurner feed</a>!

By clicking on the new Link in the sidebar you will find the new Feed that will not only syndicate this Blog and it's posts, but also my <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-admin/del.icio.us%20Links">del.icio.us Links</a>.

For all people who where using my old RSS Feed<strong> please update your subscription</strong> to the new URL.
