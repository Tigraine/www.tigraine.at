<p>Oh man, I was <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/2008/07/18/rant-visual-studio-injecting-ids-to-absolutely-everything/">complaining about it</a> and going nuts on this. But looks like I've found the solution (while having another more annoying problem):</p>  <p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="428" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/image.png" width="747" border="0" /></p>  <p>See it? That box over there saying: Auto ID elements on paste in Source view? Man, I knew this setting has to be somewhere!</p>
