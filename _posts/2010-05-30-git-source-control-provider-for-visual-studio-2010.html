<p>During <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/2010/05/30/barcamp-vienna-2010/">my presentation at Barcamp Vienna</a> today I got asked what GUI to use with Git. My plain and simple answer was: “Use the command line, its just better that way.. “. Well, after the talk <a href="http://www.andreas-schlapsi.com/">Andreas</a> approached me and raised a very good point: Mainstream adoption of tools (like Git) often depends on GUIs to help people during the transition phase. </p>  <p>Besides the obvious Guis like TortoiseGit or GitGui there is now one more tool aimed at .NET developers to make the transition easier: <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/63a7e40d-4d71-4fbb-a23b-d262124b8f4c">Git Source Control Provider for Visual Studio 2010</a>. It looks like Microsoft got VS2010 extensibility right this time, and someone managed to implement Git integration right into the VS2010 solution explorer:</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Git Source Control Provider" src="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/63a7e40d-4d71-4fbb-a23b-d262124b8f4c/image/file/29104/1/screenshot.png?Id=29104" /></p>  <p>The Plugin is available through Visual Studio Gallery and seems to be Ms-Pl licensed and free, although I couldn’t find the code anywhere, it’s still worth checking out: <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/63a7e40d-4d71-4fbb-a23b-d262124b8f4c">Git Source Control Provider</a>.</p>
