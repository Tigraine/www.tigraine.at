We just had a very interesting issue come up on the dotless mailing list. 
Apparently there is quite a sizeable chunk of people who run their debugger with the break on ALL exceptions option, so naturally the see all exceptions a framework generates. Even those that get handled inside the framework. 

This is then getting annoying to the user and they complain about it, thinking there is something wrong with the code since the debugger halted. 

Well, there Is nothing wrong and you should really turn that off. Exceptions are an information carrier and much more expressive than error codes or returning null. Let's look at the code in question:

It's Pandora, my little IoC container we are using inside dotless to cut down on external dependencies. When trying to construct an instance it will recursively invoke the resolve method for all dependencies a class has and all it's dependencies. 
If a class has one dependency and that dependency can't be satisfied, the resolve method has to notify the resolve method higher in it's call stack that it's impossible to get the instance and the parent resolve then has to pass that information onto it's parent. 

The obvious solution here would be to just return null and check for null. But that also means nobody has a clue what component was not found because the whole call stack starts returning null. 

Meanwhile, throwing exceptions allows me to either wrap the exception at every level, giving my caller a pretty good overview what n-th dependency down the stack was missing, or just rethrow the same exception, giving me at least a definitive source of the problem.
