<p>If you are <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/2008/04/04/reading-suggestion/">following Jeff Atwood</a> at <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">CodeHorror.com</a> you may have already read it. But the statement is so true I really need to repost this quote by <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/17/PHP">Tim Bray</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>So here's my problem, based on my limited experience with PHP (deploying a couple of free apps to do this and that, and debugging a site for a non-technical friend here and there): all the PHP code I've seen in that experience has been messy, unmaintainable crap. Spaghetti SQL wrapped in spaghetti PHP wrapped in spaghetti HTML, replicated in slightly-varying form in dozens of places.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Spaghetti-code is the main thing that always comes to my mind when I try to sit down and do a template for this website.</p>
