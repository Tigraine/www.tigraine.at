<p>A very long time ago I went through the Ruby in 20 minutes tutorial when I saw this: </p>  
{% highlight ruby %}
@names.each do |name|
  puts "Hallo, #{name}!"
end

{% endhighlight %}

<p>When C# came out later I always wondered why there is no functional equivalent on the IEnumerable<T> interface, since it would be a perfect place for quick inline method calls without having to write a full foreach statement.</p>

<p>At that time my knowledge of extension methods and delegates was too limited to do this myself, but that doesn’t mean it has to stay that way. 
  <br />I finally remembered that I never got to it last time and implemented it today.</p>

<p>Oh and it’s so damn easy too:</p>


{% highlight csharp %}
public static class EachExtension
{
    public static void Each<T>(this IEnumerable<T> enumberable, Action<T> action)
    {
        foreach (var item in enumberable)
        {
            action(item);
        }
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>To use this .Each method now you simply need to be using the Namespace where the EachExtension is in and you can write code like this:</p>

<p>
  
{% highlight csharp %}
IEnumerable<string> x = new[] {"hello", "world", "how", "are", "you"};
x.Each(Console.WriteLine);

{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>Or with multiple parameters:</p>

<p>
  
{% highlight csharp %}
IEnumerable<string> x = new[] {"hello", "world", "how", "are", "you"};
x.Each(p => Console.WriteLine("{0}", p));

{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>Or, even whole inline method bodies:</p>

<p>
  
{% highlight csharp %}
IEnumerable<string> x = new[] {"hello", "world", "how", "are", "you"};
x.Each(p =>
           {
               Console.Write("Word:");
               Console.WriteLine(p);
           });

{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>So, Lambdas are fun after all :)</p>
