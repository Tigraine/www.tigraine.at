<p>Don't get me wrong, I love studying at Klagenfurt University, but whenever the weather gets more and more appealing I start dreaming of some cool cafe's and other stuff on the university campus. </p>  <p>Currently the only caf&#233; that is really located inside the university is the iQ. And that's ok, but the university is lacking more open space. Maybe you get what I mean by this picture.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/university2.jpg"><img border="0" alt="university" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/university-thumb2.jpg" width="450" height="352" /></a> (click to enlarge picture) </p>  <p>The red area is university property, while the yellow stuff is parking and the blue stuff is streets (with parking).</p>  <p>What happens is that whenever you step outside the building after 10 meters or so you happen to either reach a parking lot or a street.    <br />If you follow this <a href="http://maps.live.de//LiveSearch.LocalLive?cp=46.617256623371524~14.264722466468795&amp;scene=22973956&amp;style=a&amp;lvl=17">geo-link</a> you might find that there is plenty of green around the university, but when you are there the perception is that there is only cars :). </p>  <p>So here it comes, cut down some roads and open up the area. Remove the front parking (eastern parking lot) and make it a nice little park for students. Also I'd like to see the road in the east closed down and some nice caf&#233;s opened up. Giving so much space to parking is just a waste.</p>  <p>On the parking side: Before you can get anywhere near planning a cooler campus we need to get public transport in Klagenfurt up to speed. There should be a frequent shuttle bus from the nearby train station that may also take students to the W&#246;rthersee in summer, so more people would consider the train a viable alternative to the car. The STW bus should come every 15 minutes at least, having 2 buses per hour is simply unacceptable. </p>  <p>Klagenfurt university may be one of the few universities in Austria that isn't directly located inside the city so you could make something out of the place without having to redesign transportation for a whole city. But as it's currently more space is wasted than really used. It all feels too small and not really comfortable.</p>
