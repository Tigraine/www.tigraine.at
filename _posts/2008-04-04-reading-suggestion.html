<p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/"><img src="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/images/coding-horror-official-logo-small.png" align="left" /></a> Sorry for me being so silent for the last weeks. I've been quite busy and for a week or so I am just trying to get my unread feeds back to under 100 again.</p>  <p>That's also why I thought about writing this post.   <br />After I marked 2 consecutive posts as <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/06565692252982019118">shared</a> on my <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> I really had the urge to say this out loud:</p>  <p><strong>Thank you Jeff Atwood for your blog!</strong></p>  <p>I have been following the blog for quite some time now, and I have to admit that there is hardly any other blog I enjoyed reading as much as <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">codinghorror</a>. </p>  <p>It's not really the most informative blog if you are searching for any solid programming hints, but Jeff manages to really keep his focus on geeky - interesting tech topics that can't easily be put in niche like .NET, Java, Ruby, SOA etc.. </p>  <p>So, for anyone interested in a really great read you can find <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff's blog here</a>.</p>  <p>Oh, and the book he derived the term &quot;codinghorror&quot; from, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1207264717&amp;sr=8-1">Code Complete by Steve McConnel</a> is a very good read too!</p>
