<p>Once in a while I actually use the &quot;My Documents&quot; folder to retrieve files I've put there. Or worse, I sometimes store files there!    <br />Gosh, impossible? Hell yes! Impossible due to the shitload of folders all sorts of software vendors think I need in MY user space! Who in the hell allowed ICQ to start storing received files in there? Do I really want that? Did they ask me?     <br />Who actually decided that every damn game out there you install has the right to just go into your &quot;My Documents&quot; and place it's save games in there? If I open up my documents I get a almost 100% accurate view of what I've been playing over the last few months or so. </p>  <p>That's unacceptable! Sorry to say that, but I have 3 folders in there where I &quot;dare&quot; to put my data, while the total folder count in my &quot;My Documents&quot; is 19! So that's 16 folders I didn't create and I don't need in there. </p>  <p><em>But why did it get that bad?</em></p>  <p>The answer is simple: Because backup is painful.    <br />Even an IT pro has a hard time collecting all those config files from the various C:\Program Files\config folders, imagine a home user going through those steps. So software vendors thought: Users may know how to back up their &quot;My Documents&quot; folder, if we put our stuff in there we're safe! </p>  <p>Guess what? They made the opposite true: Users simply don't use this folder any more, most people I know keep their data on locations like &quot;D:\&quot; or some other place where they can access them conveniently without seeing unwanted folders pop up.    <br />And, I'm inclined to do the same. Screening through 16 unknown/irrelevant folders isn't something I want to be doing in a folder I thought was for my private use only!</p>  <p><em>But where to put those files?</em></p>  <p>By far the most convenient location for configuration files imo is the program directory where you've installed the application. But to be honest, I don't think the average end-user app should really need a config file. Most applications we currently use just work out of the box with very little need for configuration.</p>  <p>Secondly, there's still the AppData folder that's intended to hold application data, and by definition config files are application data. Why in the hell didn't they use this??    <br />AppData is also located in the users's profile folder so it might get backed up.</p>  <p><strong>PLEASE:</strong></p>  <p>If you're writing software, either omit configuration files (best solution!) or keep them out of my user space and save them in a location that actually makes sense!</p>  <p>Oh, and by the way. With user space I don't mean only the &quot;My Documents&quot; folder. I really can't understand why some applications (namely eclipse, oracle, visual paradigm, virtual box) decided that it's ok to put them in my C:\users\&lt;username&gt;\ instead! That folder was intended to give me quick access to my Documents, Desktop, Favorites, Downloads, Images, Music, Videos. Not to scan through those .eclipse/.sqldeveloper etc etc folders. Please guys out there, understand that windows isn't hiding folders that start with a dot from the user! That's linux and we Windows users don't want those folders to be in the root of our profile!</p>  <p><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/image-thumb7.png" width="667" height="457" /></p>
