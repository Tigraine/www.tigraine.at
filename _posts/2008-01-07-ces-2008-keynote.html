<p><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; float: left; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 10px; border-right-width: 0px" height="191" alt="billgates" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/billgates.png" width="178" border="0" /> You know that you have some serious affinity toward Microsoft software and technologies when you live in Austria (being GMT+1) and stay up waiting to watch Bill Gates deliver his <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/executives/billgates.mspx">keynote speech</a> at 6:30 PM Pacific Time (GMT-8) (that's only 9 hours of difference, meaning it's been 3:30 AM here in Austria) at the <a href="http://www.sandsexpo.com/">Sands Expo and Convention Center</a> in Las Vegas!</p>  <p>And hey, I really really regret it!</p>  <ul style="margin-left: 10px; list-style-type: disc">   <li>Now I need to get myself a ugly Fiat or Ford to have Microsoft Auto on my car. </li>    <li>They made some vague assumptions that the Zune will launch in Europe someday (man I didn't want to spend those 300&#8364;). </li>    <li>They made me even more eager to buy an XBox360 (man, my girlfriend almost had talked me out of this!). </li>    <li>I now seriously need to get myself a Windows Mobile powered cell. </li> </ul>  <p>So, frankly - I loved this keynote.    <br />I mean, I've seen most of this stuff somewhere before. There is a reason most of my friends ask whether I am paid by Microsoft for talking about their newest technologies all the time.     <br />But still, Gates and Robbie Bach somehow managed to deliver their message.</p>

  <p><strong>Good, but short!</strong></p>  <p>Whoever looked upon the <a href="http://www.silverlight.net">Silverlight</a> technology and it's uses, knows that to showcase <a href="http://www.silverlight.net">Silverlight</a> you clearly need the full keynote, not only some 3 minute spot from NBC.</p>  <p>If you've ever heard word from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/">Microsoft Surface</a> knows that that one technology alone is so freaking great that Steve Jobs would need 2 keynotes to promote it.     <br />You should definitely check out the Videos on the offial Page as well as some on Youtube (like <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=-9j_tYP-kzc">this one</a>, or <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=FlZxuqjJDgk">this one</a>).</p>  <p>Something that also fell short was Microsoft Auto.    <br />Although I didn't knew too much about this service before the keynote, I am very sure that they showed it wrong.     <br />So, basically: Microsoft Auto is your new board-computer in your car. You have access to devices like your Zune, your Cellphone (running Windows Mobile) etc etc.. And that through voice recognition and integration into the car.     <br />So, what did they do wrong? First off, they showed the Zune connected to car through a simple cable. - Heck, I know that the Zune has WiFi, and I am pretty sure it can't be so fucking difficult to build WiFi into my brand-new car! So why do they need that cable? Cables are for iPhones, I've got my Zune to get rid of those cables. They managed to connect my phone through Bluetooth, why not my Zune.     <br />The way they showcased that stuff it looked like the presentation for some built-in hands-free device to control your Zune, not a entertainment and media-system that makes my car more fun!     <br />(They only briefly mentioned a new service that's calling 911 when your airbag goes off and you don't interrupt the car's cry for help.)</p>  <p>On the XBox360, I am very pleased to hear that it's features will go way beyond gaming so that I may have some leverage in my ongoing discussion with my beloved one about buying an XBox360.    <br />The XBox360 will start selling as a set-top box for Microsoft Mediaroom (their new IPTV Service) and in the near future start to broadcast (on the normal XBox360) shows from Disney and abc (Lost, Grey's Anatomy, Desperate Housewives) through XBox Live. So maybe buying an XBox360 is a key to getting my digital home-entertainment system (after Intel failed me with their Viiv technology).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Oh, and by the way, you can watch the Keynote <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/executives/billgates.mspx">here</a>.</p>
