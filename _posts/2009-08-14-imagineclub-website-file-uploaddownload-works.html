<p>Oh it’s been quiet for a very very long time around here imagineClub-wise. And I’m afraid to say that progress has been rather slow.</p>  <p>Well, today I finally around to implement file downloads/uploads and the file listing in the sidebar section. In all it’s glory it was nothing more than 10 lines of C# code and tons and tons of XHTML and CSS that I’d rather not go into. </p>  <p>Here are some screenshots of the current version:</p>  <p>&#160;<a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/image2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/image-thumb1.png" width="234" height="244" /></a> <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/image3.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/image-thumb2.png" width="234" height="244" /></a> </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p>It’s really rough around the edges and I will probably need to bring in a markdown editor to allow formatting when posting. I plan on stealing Ken Egozi’s Windows Live Writer integration for the news section, but when users upload files to the site they need to have some way of formatting their text. </p>  <p>Also I’ll look into <a href="http://blog.smoothfriction.nl/archive/2009/08/13/lesscss-the-.net-edition.aspx" target="_blank">Less.NET</a> to manage my CSS because it is becoming very very verbose at the moment and restructuring it is just painful. This is mainly due to the fact that I want to keep the markup was ignorant to presentation as possible and as expressive as possible. All forms are built with accessibility in mind and are passing the webaim tests.</p>  <p>Next up on my list is a search/list option for uploaded files. Maybe improve the file organization a bit more and then start to write the ELMS integration to allows logged in users access to the MSDN-AA. Once we are done with the ELMS thing I’d dare to launch the site. </p>
