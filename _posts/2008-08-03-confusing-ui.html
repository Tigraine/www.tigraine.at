<p>After getting myself a new Dell XPS M1330 laptop, I thought it would be cool to have a Bluetooth mouse that could also serve as a presenter. </p>  <p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="109" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/image.png" width="378" border="0" /></p>  <p>So I got the Microsoft Presenter Mouse 8000. After opening the control panel I was presented with the above display.</p>  <p>It's in German so I'll translate:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Current power source: Battery     <br />Remaining Energy for: 1%.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Ok I just unboxed the whole thing, why I ended up with a 1% charge - I don't know.&#160; </p>  <p>But, what really bugs me is: This UI is pretty meaningless to me. I mean, if my battery is low, why isn't anything red? Why in the hell doesn't the driver alert me that my battery is low? And, the top line has to be the most useless thing I've ever seen anywhere ever. This is a Bluetooth mouse that has only one way of getting power: battery. And they really tell me that it's running off battery?   <br />And the image of the battery doesn't help either. Does gray mean full, or maybe empty? Is the color for full green? I would expect it, but it's not obvious. </p>  <p>Finally, the accuracy and reception really sucks right now. I hope this is for the low battery, but still I don't understand why the driver isn't alerting me that I need to replace my battery.</p>
