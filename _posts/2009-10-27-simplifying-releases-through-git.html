<p>I confess: I <strong>love </strong>writing build scripts. They are usually insanely easy to write, and provide you with a disproportional amount of value over time that it’s almost tragic not to have them. And, I love git.     <br />So, what’s better than to see git simplifying my buildfiles :).</p>  <p>Imagine the usual: Your assembly version is encoded in your buildfile, so whenever you want to release you do the following:</p>  <ol>   <li>Increment version number in buildfile </li>    <li>Run buildfile </li>    <li>Create a tag in your SCM for the released version </li> </ol>  <p>Now, thanks to the smart people at the castle mailing list I found out about the <tt>git describe</tt> command. By using <a href="http://mirrors.xservers.ro/software/scm/git-core/docs/git-describe.html">git-describe</a> you can simplify the above to just:</p>  <ol>   <ol>     <li>Create a tag in your SCM </li>      <li>Run buildfile </li>   </ol> </ol>  <p>The function for that is quite simple:</p>  
{% highlight csharp %}
function Get-Git-Commit
{
    return git describe
}

function Get-Git-Version
{
    $v = git describe --abbrev=0
    return $v -replace "v", ""
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Get-Git-Commit is returning the full name of the build, giving me a string like: <tt>v0.1.0.2-2-gd19ce0f. 
    <br /></tt>And Get-Git-Version will output the tag-name without the leading v so it can be used as the product version inside the assembly info.

  <br />My buildscript then uses this version information from git to write my AssemblyInfo.cs files and build numbers have started to magically change!</p>

<p>This technique helps me to avoid all the hassle of incrementing build numbers, but instead allows me to focus on my work more. Once I feel the release is done, I simply hit:</p>

<p><tt>git tag –a v1.0.0.1</tt></p>

<p>(don’t forget to use <tt>git push –tags</tt> to get them to your server)</p>

<p>Hey, that’s awesome! There has to be a catch right? Indeed, there is:</p>

<p>If git is not installed, you can’t compile. Bummer I know, especially since the unwashed masses are in the process of slowly grasping the concept of SVN, who would want to throw a DVCS like git at them? 
  <br />This is why all of my build script have a step called release that packs everything together in one nice zip file and I can then upload it to some server. In case someone has no git, he’s stuck with my binary files. </p>

<p>You can see this in action by looking at these open-source buildfiles I wrote lately: <a href="http://github.com/Tigraine/nLess/blob/master/default.ps1">dotless</a>, <a href="http://github.com/Tigraine/elms-connector">elms-connector</a>.</p>
