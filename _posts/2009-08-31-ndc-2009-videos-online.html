<p>The Norwegian Developer Conference is over for quite some time now, and by looking at their speaker line-up itâ€™s quite clear that I would have loved to be there.</p>  <p>Good for me that they videotaped all talks and decided to share them with the general public.</p>  <p>So, if you are interested in seeing Ayende, Michael Feathers, Scott Hanselman, Jeremy D. Miller, Phil Haack or Udi Dahan doing their talks, you can either stream them online, or you can go ahead and download a 30GB torrent with all of their talks. </p>  <p>The videos are <a href="http://ndc2009.no/en/agenda.aspx?cat=1071&amp;id=1813" target="_blank">online on the official conference page</a>, or if you prefer a per-speaker listing:    <br />Mark Nijhof has a list of <a href="http://blog.fohjin.com/blog/2009/7/1/NDC_videos_are_published" target="_blank">all NDC videos for your streaming pleasure</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/grothaug/pages/downloadable-ndc2009-videos.aspx" target="_blank">Rune Grothaug has the torrent</a>.</p>  <p>(Please keep seeding the torrent for a bit after your download has finished)</p>
