<p>In an ongoing effort to get into NVelocity while programming the <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/category/programmierung/projects/imagineclub-website/">iC-Website</a> I wanted to concatenate a filename with the current loop count variable:</p>  
{% highlight xml %}
<img src="/Content/images/dummy$velocityCount.png" alt="post-image" />

{% endhighlight %}

<p>This isn’t working. You’ll end up with <em>dummy$velocityCount.png</em>. While I’d like it to result in <em>dummy1.png</em>.

  <br />I suspected it could be solved somehow by using our beloved angle bracket to tell NV to explicitly evaluate my text:</p>


{% highlight xml %}
<img src="/Content/images/dummy{$velocityCount}.png" alt="post-image" />

{% endhighlight %}

<p>This will result is <em>dummy{1}.png</em>, why is beyond me but NV will parse it. Still this doesn’t really work so I found the solution on how to explicitly invoke NV evaluation in the NV users guide:</p>


{% highlight xml %}
<img src="/Content/images/dummy${velocityCount}.png" alt="post-image" />

{% endhighlight %}

<p>This is nothing really new, it’s all laid out in the <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/engine/releases/velocity-1.5/user-guide.html#string_concatenation">NV users-guide</a>, still especially the second case made me scratch my head for a moment. </p>
