<p>Well, I already told you about the Castle blog aggregator as a source for <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/2009/07/25/keeping-up-with-castle/" target="_blank">keeping up to date with the Castle project</a>. Turns out the idea was taken even further and the feed has now been integrated into the <a href="http://www.castleproject.org">www.castleproject.org</a> under <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/community/blogs.aspx" target="_blank">Community/Blogs</a>.</p>  <p>What I never anticipated was that I’d one day get this email by <a href="http://bugsquash.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Mauricio Scheffer</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Hi Daniel, would you be interested in being included in the <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/community/blogs.aspx">Castle blog aggregator</a>?       <br />Your posts tagged as &quot;Castle&quot; would be automatically included.</p>    <p>Cheers,      <br />Mauricio</p> </blockquote>  <p>My immediate answer was <u>Yes</u>! I’m very happy to be able to contribute to castle in any way possible, and seeing people consider my posts interesting is very rewarding to me. Thanks Mauricio!</p>
