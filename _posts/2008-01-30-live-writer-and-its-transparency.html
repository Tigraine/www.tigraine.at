<p>Since I got my 24&quot; HP monitor I really started to fancy the new Vista Aero glass effects that let my desktop shine through borders and stuff.    <br />Although I usually stockpile window upon window, that little blur effect on the windows is something I definitely like about Vista.</p>  <p>Due to all this common Vista look'n'feel I never really noticed that Windows Live Writer is a .NET 2.0 application using Windows Forms <strong>AND</strong> (&amp;&amp;) having a transparency effect on it's splash screen!</p>  <p><img alt="Windows Live Writer" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/wlw.png" /></p>  <p>So, why this never came to my mind is something I don't know, but today I closed a background window while starting up WLW and found out that my desktop and the WLW splash where out of sync.</p>  <p>Basically, Windows Live Writer has no transparency of it's own. It just takes a screenshot and handles the transparency effect in it's form.    <br />If the screen behind WLW splash is changing, changes don't reflect onto the slash page (as they do in Vista aero).</p>  <p>Funny stuff, but definitely something I'd keep in mind when it gets to fancy looks on pre-WPF projects.</p>
