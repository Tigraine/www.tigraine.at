<p>This is directly from the standard MVC template upon starting a new project:</p>  
{% highlight csharp %}
// This constructor is used by the MVC framework to instantiate the controller using
// the default forms authentication and membership providers.

public AccountController()
    : this(null, null)
{
}

// This constructor is not used by the MVC framework but is instead provided for ease
// of unit testing this type. See the comments at the end of this file for more
// information.
public AccountController(IFormsAuthentication formsAuth, IMembershipService service)
{
    FormsAuth = formsAuth ?? new FormsAuthenticationService();
    MembershipService = service ?? new AccountMembershipService();
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>I didn’t realize this is in the default template of <strong><u>ANY</u></strong> MVC install when <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2009/07/30/reviewing-nerddinner.aspx">Ayende pointed this out in his NerdDinner review</a> yesterday. Wow, speaking of bad defaults.. </p>

<p>If you don’t want to burden yourself with “real” IoC, at least do it right:</p>
