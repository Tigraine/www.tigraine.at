<p><a href="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/image.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/image-thumb.png" width="261" height="49" /></a> </p>  <p><a href="http://skydrive.live.com/">Skydrive</a>, one of the cooler things Microsoft released lately under their <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/2008/01/12/windows-live/">Live.com brand</a> has somehow replaced my private FTP server for sharing files with myself and others. </p>  <p>It's cool, it's easy and it's free. You get 5 gigs of free storage with your Live.com Id that you can use to upload data to the cloud.    <br />You then get a quite neat folder view online where you can download those files, set their permissions etc.     <br />So, if I want to share some files with a friend I can add them to the folder's permission list and they can see them with their Live.com Ids. If anyone should be able to see something I just add it to my globally shared folder. </p>  <p>So, whenever I need data at university I just upload it to SkyDrive instead of emailing it to myself as I used to do. It's usually just boring university assignments but after a few weeks things start to get messy. I started out by creating one folder for every course, not dividing up into assignments. So now I have 20 files in my dbtec course folder, all called &quot;Dbt_AssX.doc&quot; accompanied by some .sql and .txt files. </p>  <p>I then tried to correct that mistake, created a new folder to split up stuff, and - voila, there is no way to move a file from folder a to folder b! <strong>That sucks!     <br /></strong>I was already concerned about the missing API (uploading stuff through the browser isn't cool!), but being unable to move stuff around is quite annoying. </p>  <p>If we're at it, I'd really appreciate some sort of slightly more accessible UI. Deleting a folder isn't as easy as clicking the folder and hitting delete, no, you need to click the folder, access it's properties through clicking on it's name and then pressing delete. </p>
